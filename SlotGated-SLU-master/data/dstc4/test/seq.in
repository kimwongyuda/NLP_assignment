uh like the orang-utan
um in um for example i will take the hotel you say about a while ago

uh you can always go to the city hall mrt
at the mrt it's a subway
and you take the north line towards ang mo kio station and from ang mo kio you change a bus a public bus

okay
okay thank you
um and it
do you know how to take the public transport
um i don't have any idea
can you please uh elaborate that for me
alright
for the mrt you pay according to the distance travelled
so you will buy a ticket
uh when you arrived at the station uh in within the busy areas like the vicinity of the city hall area to the orchard area
uh the mrt runs beneath the road
so you go down to the basement area
and there would be a ticket machine
uh you will have to carry some singapore money with you if you want to take our public transport
okay
uh yes
so you just uh press a button to tell you the to tell the computer uh the machine which station are you going to alight
and the machine will tell you how much money uh the fare will be
okay
alright
okay thank you
and how um for example i'm carrying a uh dollar um for my currency
what would be the recommended uh currency when i were when i was there in the singapore
uh well uh i would recommend you to change some singapore money
uh if you are going to take uh public transport
uh in case you want to buy some street food
so i would recommend that you change um money into singapore money
um can i ask uh what will be the change uh foreign exchange uh from dollar to singaporean dollar
uh are you talking about us dollars
yup
okay from us dollars to singapore dollars uh the rate now is approximately about one singapore dollars will give you approximately uh a dollar uh twenty seven cents us uh sorry
uh one us dollar would give you approximately about a one dollar twenty seven cents
hm oh hm
singapore money
okay thank you so much
and uh can i ask uh if i will go there by the mid of april do you have any festivals uh during that date
so uh if i can um saw see what how festivals in singapore and compare it from here
uh for the period of april we do not have any major festivals coming up
yah
if ever uh what would be the uh best festival
so if i have uh next time visit i will go during that uh those months
okay the i would say well it's very festive and a lot of people uh are very busy preparing for the festival
i would say it uh will be among our major festival like chinese new year sometime in january
uh period the uh preparation before uh the actual festival
and also the uh festival that's celebrated by the malays will be hari raya
okay
and also deepavali in november
and uh christmas time in december
so i have put on the screen our public holidays calendar for this year
chinese new year is over now
uh it was celebrated on the twenty third and twenty fourth
so the whole month of january was very busy in chinatown
okay
oh
yup
uh may we have vesak day
alright
uh no major preparation before vesak day
yup
uh the next uh major festival would be hari raya in august
and deepavali in the month of november
okay
yes i see
alright
so this will be more um i would say the major festival where you will see a lot more preparation um and a very carnival festive mood uh just before this public holidays
okay
and also can i add um i if i'm a nature lover um if there's any uh tourist spots that you will recommend to me
uh nature as in plants or in birds or fishes
um i think um
or coral i mean uh marine life
um uh plants or uh looks like um a park or anythings that i can see some natures
see some nature
okay
well i would like to recommend you this uh hill which is at a very popular hill in singapore for the local as well
alright
we call it the bukit timah nature reserve
okay
this is our tallest hill in singapore
okay
okay you can see some pictures now
uh and in fact our bukit timah nature reserve has one of the um a lot of uh flora and fauna as you climb up the hill
yup
but as if you are too tired you can always turn around and there will be some small animals that you will see along the way
okay
is there any um
okay so this is the bukit timah
okay
um can i ask is there any um uh entrance fee or a fee that we i have to pay before entering that uh reserve nature reserve
okay
there's no entrance fee um and it would be better if you either go in the morning or the evening
hm okay
is there any uh particular rules that should i um follow when
uh well of course uh dress comfortably good walking shoes
uh bring water with you and also hat with you
okay
okay
and of course do not wander off the normal trail
that means if there's no trail do not walk on those trail
so just do the normal walkway and there are also walking trail there will be signs that this is a walking trail
do not wander off the normal walking trail and you will be fine
okay
okay
is there eh oh
it is uh quite a popular hill
so there will be usually uh some people that you will meet along the way
it's just not like so quiet that you don't see anybody at all
okay
um is there uh there is an uh restaurant or a some food chain uh even uh for example we don't want to carry some loads to bring us there
is there any restaurant uh when we uh so we can eat there
okay for the bukit nature reserve park uh we don't have any uh restaurants out there but just across the road uh there are quite a few eating places
so when you alight uh when you climb down from the tree uh from the hill just go across the road and there will be quite a lot of eating places out there
uh restaurants as well as non-air conditioned uh we call it coffee shops
uh okay
um uh anything else
so maybe yes so maybe at the same time if you're going to climb uh bukit timah you can also bring along some snacks with you
uh just also uh be careful don't put your food items in plastic bag
put them inside your bag because uh there will be some monkeys on the hill
okay
and they will think that you know your plastic bag would have contained food and they may um disturb you
okay thank you
and how about uh anything else that um where we can go uh for visit
okay i mentioned earlier on uh i would like to recommend the zoo
uh for your uh child because uh our zoo is very nice
and it uh the animals are not keep are not kept in uh cages
oh
so it's an open zoo
he will get to see or you will get to see elephants orang-utans
uh in fact singapore zoo has the largest collection of orang-utan
okay
so i'm showing you the uh okay i will show you the uh attractions
uh that can be found in the zoo
okay
i think this will interest him the polar bear
okay
um i have a just limited time to visit uh singapore
it's about for one or to two days
uh for one day i can travel around to around singapore
i mean for uh do
uh yes
can i um i will visit every eh tourist spots in singapore within a day
uh well i would say that you have to be selective
uh we have so many things to see in singapore so if it's just a one day programme
then you can do a three hours tour of the zoo
or you can do at morning the bukit timah hill and have a lunch in uh one of our local non-air conditioned to the zoo
alright
uh huh
and in lunch time you can actually do a relaxing river cruise on the singapore river
okay
okay so i will just show you uh the river cruise
uh just a short ride on the singapore river
uh yes
so that will be something quite relaxing
and after your river cruise you could have a dinner
yes you can see the boat now
on this kind of river cruise it's about a half an hour cruise
and you could alight at the this is the uh the clarke quay area or boat quay area and have a nice dinner
okay
for how much uh for a ride in the cruise
the cruise will cost you fifteen dollars for an adult
and for your child it will be eight dollars singapore money
okay
okay
uh for the cruise it includes the food
uh no on the cruise itself there's no food provided
it's just a cruise on the singapore river
so it's just half an hour ride
and there will be a commentary uh on the cruise itself to tell you what you are looking at on the left and right-hand side of the uh places that you're going to pass by
alright
the cruise yes this is the cruise that i'm talking about
okay
it's a chinese looking kind of a boat
uh huh
and uh can you give some uh examples that you're talking about
the places where i can see like in during that cruise
which one will be the highlight of the cruise
okay
the cruise like i mentioned is only a half an hour ride
yup
uh you will pass by some of the highlight the financial district area
uh so you see a lot of skyscrapers
and uh you will see uh bridges
alright old bridges in singapore
and you will also get to see uh you will also get to see uh the old warehouses
uh okay
um and of course the icon of singapore the merlion
yes okay
okay
so on this is what you are going to see uh on the cruise
so it's just a short cruise
if you look on the right-hand side uh can you see the blue shaded area
okay this is actually the singapore river
okay so you will be travelling out this way out to the marina bay
okay
now i'm gonna just show you this picture here
okay now you can see
yes
alright
so this is the boat that's going to uh travel on the singapore river you're going to see uh this scene
okay
uh now the houses that's yellow in colour uh that is actually clarke quay
so i'm saying that when the boat gets stopped back you can go for a dinner a nice dinner
whether you choose to have a fine dining or casual place cafe there are all uh kind of food there including spanish mexican indian chinese seafood barbecue
they're all found there
so you can walk around and choose a restaurant that you like
okay
yes
alright
so this is what you're going to see uh on the cruise itself
and uh of course they when you come out of the bay you will see the merlion uh icon
yes
okay
uh for in terms of communication what are what would be the preferred language if there you know
oh
our language of administration here is english so our street sign uh will be english
all our documents will be english
the menu um given to you by the restaurants will also be written in english
all service staff will be speaking english
okay that's nice
um anything else in si in the package uh so where we can where can i go
uh for one day
okay this is the programme that i would say uh it has something for your son to do
yah
as well as uh a little bit of relaxing cruise in the night time
but of course there are lots of other things that you can do in singapore
for example we have universal studio in sentosa
uh you could also do that instead of doing the zoo
um in the afternoon you could go over to sentosa and do universal studio in the afternoon
uh huh
uh what we uh what i'm
what will be the highlights there in universal studio
okay
the highlight i think uh that will be different
there are other uh stu uh universal studios do not have would be the latest ride it's called transformer
okay
okay
so this is quite an exciting ride uh for you and your son
yah this is the ride that i'm talking about
so there are seven zones uh to explore in universal uh studio
you can see there's hollywood new york sci-fi ancient egypt and lost world and far far away and madagascar
alright
so these are the seven zone uh that you can visit in universal studio
oh yes
okay
okay
you can see all these are the scene uh street scene of universal studio
so there are lots of rides there as well
uh okay
is there any particular uh museums where we can go in singapore
uh for both your son and yourself or more for your son
yah
for hm yes
more for your son
yup
uh alright
i would uh recommend to you uh to bring him to the science centre in singapore
it's um it will be suitable for a young uh person
is there an entran
okay and yes
uh on is there an entrance fee
yes the admission charges uh for the science centre uh would be
nine dollars for an adult and five dollars for the children for the child
okay
and it is located in the western part of singapore
okay
do you need me to give you direction how to get there
yes please
okay
now um i will always come back to city hall mrt
because this is one of our interchange
and uh it's the interchange between the east and the west line
uh so because we have not chosen the hotel yet so i will just for reference go back to city hall
from city hall you take the west line and you alight at jurong east mrt train station
from there when you come out you will just walk about ten minutes and you get to the singapore science centre
oh
well okay thank you
um do you have any uh beaches in there in singapore
uh what do you say
um beach
oh beach
yes we do have beach on the mainland
uh but it is it will be just a simple beach
yup
oh
and uh yes
can you can you please uh show me
okay i will show you the uh beaches in singapore
yup
uh this is in the east coast so it's just a simple beach
alright
uh it's a little bit rocky over in the uh east coast and also the changi beach uh of singapore
is it open for the public
do you want to go there for swimming or is it for swimming
yes
oh for swimming okay
i like swimming yup
uh well the changi beach and the east coast beach um will not be fine sand
alright it's a little bit rocky
okay
the sand is a little bit um coarse
but uh on saturdays afternoon and sundays afternoon the you will see more local people going there for swimming
otherwise we have uh better beaches over on sentosa island
like uh palawan as well as uh siloso beach over on the sentosa island
okay thank you
uh anything else you can add with aside from some those tourist spots that you have given to me
uh okay if you intend to extend your holidays in singapore of course like i said there's a lot more things to do
uh now i'm actually showing you a map of sentosa
but for one day uh you really have to be very selective so we do have other museums in singapore or like the national museum which highlights the uh history of singapore
uh arts museum uh where you see contemporary art
um war museum
okay if your son is interested uh to know a little bit about the war because singapore was occupied by the japanese
uh we do have quite a few war museums as well
um so for visits to museum well depending on how big the museum is
okay
minimum one to three hours alright would be sufficient
okay
uh for a tourist uh what would be the maximum days that will give the immigration will give for a tourist
okay
uh normally for immigration we give a one month uh visitor pass
hm okay
so you seems to be concerned about some rules and regulation with singapore
yes
can you please uh tell me something about it
uh okay
like i said uh we do not encourage littering
um uh so if you does any litter please throw them into the uh litter bins the rubbish bin
uh for lighting of uh cigarette there are quite a few restriction now including the airport
so um in short very simple anything that's indoor in the restaurants yes we do not allow uh cigarettes to be lighted up
uh including bus stop
so there must be uh like an area uh from the enclosed area that you can do uh light up of cigarettes
uh yes
so i think these are the major concern otherwise uh crime rate here is pretty low
uh you are able to move around quite freely even in the night time
as usual just avoid all the dark lanes um and do not carry too much cash with you
uh that then you will be having a very enjoyable time in singapore
hm okay so uh okay thank you for that informations
um uh about uh um i've heard that uh you have a night safari
can you please uh tell me something about it
okay the night safari opens in the night time
from seven thirty to eight o'clock
again it is an open night safari you won't see cages in this night safari
it is just next door to the zoo
okay so if your son is really into animals you could do the afternoon zoo
at night you could bring him over just next door to the night safari
now if you look at the first picture
uh this is a tram that brings you around the night safari
so that you are not too tired
you don have to walk the entire park
and on this two tram ride itself of course you see about seventy per cent of the animals
uh huh
it will be different from what you see in the zoo
so you see the leopards here the malayan tapir the fishing cat
okay
uh huh
and if you are not too tired you can do a walk short walk in the middle of the tram ride there is the tram will stop you can do a walking trail towards the leopard area
uh that will take you about forty minutes
half an hour to forty minutes and you go back to the tram station and board back the next tram
that will bring you back to the entrance area and you can do another walking trail called the fishing cat trail
oh hm
alright
so and if you are not too tired again there is a forest giant trail
again from the entrance area that you can walk
alright fishing cat trail about twenty minutes
and if you want to see some shows we do have two shows in the night safari
uh but usually there's a long queue to see the creatures of the night show
okay
okay
okay
this is a show. it's a
this is a show. it's a just a twenty minute show thirty minute show
and they will bring in some animals uh the smaller animals uh for the audience to look at
hm and how about the admission fee how much is that
how much is that
okay the admission fee for the night safari will be thirty two dollars for the adult
and the child will be twenty one dollars
okay
i think it's nice
um that one is good for my child
um i also heard that there is a um ocean park uh do i um do you have an ocean park there in singapore
yes we call our uh ocean park the underwater world
alright
yes
alright
and this is located in um sentosa island
okay
can you please uh show me some datas ab show our datas some datas about that um underworld
okay the underworld is located on sentosa island
so i'm now flashing you some of the photographs taken in the underwater world
now over here uh the highlight would be you go into the basement area
you step on the travelator and you were actually in an underground uh tank a very big tank
so inside the travelator you will get to see sharks alright
stingray and lots of other kinds of fishes
uh in this underwater world you don't have to walk
alright the travelator will bring you around
uh you can really get to see a lot of uh marine life when you're in this uh travelator
now besides this travelator if you look at the bottom right-hand corner
hm okay
uh huh
oh
these are what we call mimicry
you see this uh yellow colour looking marine life
yup
okay
now it's on the screen now
now if this marine cry uh marine uh sea creature it's among the seaweeds
you can really miss this marine uh sea creature
okay
alright they actually looks like a seaweed or a plant
yes
it's looks like a seahorse weed
yes
but actually if it's among the plant you can't even miss this um uh sea creature
okay so these are just some of the sea marine life that you would see in the underwater world
but this is on sentosa island
so if you're going to choose sentosa then you can do the beach the underwater world and the universal studio all in one day because they're in the same location
oh i see
i think i have uh last more concern about
for example uh i have uh given for one or to two days
uh i have i want to extend uh my stay in singapore
uh what should i do uh to extend
uh do i need to go to immigration or to extend the date
uh no because when you come in to singapore our immigration officers uh would normally give you a one month stay in singapore
so there's no need to extend it uh your stay in singapore
okay
uh huh
but do check on your passport you know what is the validity that's given to you
but i would say normally one month
uh okay
uh if i exceeded one month what
okay if you forgot alright uh to see what is your length of stay in singapore and you overstayed in singapore then please bring your passport and yourself to our immigration office in lavender uh street
alright we have an immigration uh office there
and tell them uh your situation
oh okay
i think i have uh all the information that i needed
um anything else you want to add um
alright
for if you intend to visit the universal studio i will recommend that you book your tickets online first just in case you know that day happens to be a very crowded day because we do have a limit uh as in uh visitors uh going into the universal studio
okay
uh how much for the admission fee
uh to the universal studio for the adult on a weekday it will be sixty eight dollars
uh weekends public holidays will be seventy four dollars
for the child it will be fifty dollars
and weekend will be uh fifty four uh dollars
uh also for uh certain rides in the universal studio there's a height limit
uh for certain rides like roller coaster the child would be have uh to be approximately about uh one point two uh metres tall
okay for certain rides in the park
oh okay
okay thank you very much for that uh for helping me
um that's all
so i hope you will you know uh visit us soon
yes i will
thank you so much
alright
welcome
bye
bye

so it can actually take in about uh twenty people in one capsule yah
yes
twenty people
so it's a glass yah
it's glass uh i will say it looks like a bag
yah
okay so this is the singapore flyer
wow
um what about the dining
um are we allowed to um take a uh even um for example dinner or lunch
okay on normal days we don't provide uh dining in the capsule
this will be provided for special occasions like for example valentine's day yes we do um uh lunch or dinner that is provided inside this flyer
yes that's the capsule
a photo of the capsule
um otherwise if you just want to bring a bit of a snack that's actually fine as well
oh i see
um how much it will cost um for two people
yah
okay the singapore flyer will cost you twenty nine dollars and fifty cents uh for one person for an adult
the child will cost you twenty dollars and sixty five cent
so that would be for two person will be twenty nine uh fifty times two for two adults
okay
um that will be how long again
it's twenty minutes ride
yah that's right
twenty minutes oh that's great
yah
alright
um moving forward um what about in universal studio
um what attraction are available to see
okay for the universal studio there are lots of attractions there
we have seven zones that you can see
okay as you can see now on the screen there are seven zones alright
there are rides like roller coaster if you're looking to be very exciting
roller coaster if you madagascar and our latest ride would be the transformer
the first picture over here
okay so this is something i think the whole family will enjoy
uh interesting ride
oh yes
alright i see
yes um in uh what about in roller coaster um how much it will cost me if ever
okay the price that you pay for admission to the universal studio includes uh almost all the rides in universal studio
hm so
alright
so yes that is already included
all the rides
yes
and how much is that
yes
okay the universal admission is sixty eight dollars for weekday
seventy four dollars for weekends and holidays
child will be fifty dollars uh and fifty four for uh public holidays and sundays uh weekends
so um lynnette um what is the nearest hotel for the location that we would love to go to
okay closest hotel of course would be on sentosa island
we have a few uh resort that is located on the island
for example uh we have um okay i'm going to show you the hotels okay
crockford hotel uh hotel michael hardrock hotel festive hotel equarius and beach villas
these are located just in the whole of resort world
okay so if you're talking about very close these are the hotels
do you want me to provide you the price range
yes please
uh much bet
the price range for this hotel is in the range of about four hundred and above
four hundred dollars
and above for one room
but they are
it's quite expensive
yes
um what about
because these are resort hotels
what about um uh i mean it's not um just not near in the universal studio
what about uh one ride or at least we can save more money
um a three-star hotel is okay or even the one two-star hotel
alright there is a very uh a hotel small hotel that is quite near to uh on the mainland that is quite near to the uh harbourfront where you will take the sentosa express to get on to the universal studio
and the name of this hotel is harbourville
harbourville
um do you have any idea how much it will cost us um for two days with two adults
okay
okay this one is in the region of uh approximately uh about a hundred and fifteen dollars
per night
yes per night
okay this is the hotel
it's just a small hotel uh no uh restaurant facilities
yes it's about a hundred and twenty five dollars
so if you are talking about very close and this hotel is possible to walk to the uh harbourfront
wow
okay now if you wanna a lit something a little bit better uh i would say this hotel uh just about uh one stop away uh from the harbourfront
okay there is this hotel called m hotel
okay
okay it's located in the financial district area
okay
so this would be uh a nicer hotel alright
it is still convenient to get there
but otherwise uh most of the hotels are even in orchard road is not that difficult to get to the harbourfront
oh i see
so eh this one in m hotel how much it will cost us
uh this would be in the region of two hundred over uh dollars
two hundred dollars per night
two hundred plus
two hundred plus
yes
that will be per night right
yes correct
hm um wh
per night means you check-in at three o'clock two o'clock three o'clock and you will have to leave the hotel by twelve the next day
oh i see
so that is um the check-in advice us to stay for two days
um i think we can can you check for me about um my budget is only eighty dollars to one hundred dollars per night
okay uh eighty dollars
do you mind staying in a backpackers hotel
yah i don't see any problem with that
okay we do have uh backpackers hotel in singapore
okay
okay there are quite a lot of uh backpackers hotel in singapore
now uh again depending on the uh location that is
location
yes that you want to stay
okay i'm giving you some list here of the hotels for backpackers
they are all below a hundred dollars
hm that's great
um much better as well if we get um just uh close to the area that we'd love to go
yah
as close as possible
yes
okay then i would say that uh there is a hotel called the inns over in chinatown
i think that would be very close already uh to the uh harbourfront
oh so um for that wha um for that hotel it will only cost me less than a dollar
yes
uh less than one hundred dollars
yes that's right
so that is good for two or only
okay i'm showing you now this uh that inn over at temple street
uh it will be for uh one person
the rates
that's great
yah
yes you are right in the heart of chinatown
and is that near in the dining area like a restaurant
okay because this hote uh this uh hotel is located in chinatown so there are lots of dining options
there are um uh restaurants quite a lot of chinese restaurants including dimsum just next street and all the lanes around the chinatown area
but if you like to have um street food there is a street food call the chinatown complex
and over there um they serve uh local food and one meal let's say if you are just having the uh rice with three dishes that will cost you approximately about five singapore dollars
so with a drink it's less than seven dollars you could have a full meal
wow
wow
lovely
yah
so that is the nearest right
um if ever that um we are in the inn hotel eh at uh temple street um how long it will for us to go to sentosa singapore flyer
and what will be the ride that we can use to go there
tem okay uh this is very conveniently located
uh the closest one of course would be the chinatown mrt
the other ho uh mrt would be tanjong pagar
now tanjong pagar is actually the east-west line that you will take to go to the um harbourfront alright
uh but if you are sorry
uh no you take the chinatown uh station and go to the harbourfront
um but let say you are going to take uh to the singapore flyer then you will have to take from tanjong pagar and alight at the city hall and you take a walk about fifteen min seventeen minutes walk to the singapore flyer
okay
okay
oh i see
so um in sentosa we just need to take the same subway right
uh on sentosa island we don't have subway
uh we have what we call the sentosa buses that you can board
uh it's all included in your ticket
and you can also board the train on sentosa itself we call it the sentosa express
okay
um i see
um what about lynnette um do we need to get a visa for this
um for example we just need to go there for a uh two days trip
do we need to get a visa
a visa coming in to singapore or a visa to sentosa
oh i see
uh which uh visa are you talking about
um from here in our country to for us to go to singapore
okay for your uh and you are uh holding a philippine passport
yes
okay you won't require a visa to come to singapore
and sentosa island is our one of our island
so it's part of singapore
so there's no visa requirement
oh that's great
so do you have any idea how much it will cost for a round trip ticket
uh the flight tickets
yes
okay again i think it depends on which airline that you are taking
uh ya really very much depending of the airlines that you are taking
or would you be able to
um do you have any um can you give me at least um not quite expensive uh but um more affordable airlines that we can buy a ticket
more affordable airlines coming to singapore
yes
yes
uh i would think uh do you have budget airlines coming in
actually our budget um is one thousand singaporean dollars
okay
uh you have the cebupacific airlines coming into singapore
yes we do
yes i think that would be a cheaper ticket coming in from um singapore
coming in to singapore
i see
so um what about um the weather or do you have any advance weather forecast um for the specific date that we'll uh like to go
uh we have the same kind of temperature throughout the whole year
uh so there's no uh really specific time
okay maybe i'll just give you a run down um. i would say that it will be good to time your holidays uh together with our major festivals here like february or january period will be chinese new year
uh it gives you that festive mood
and uh the hari raya sometime in uh august alright
deepavali
august
yes sometime in november
and christmas time is also a very festive because uh we light up the whole street of orchard road
so it gives you that very festive mood
um the rest of the hari raya deepavali we light up other streets in singapore
so that gives you a very good a photography area for you to bring home uh some memories of singapore
yes some souvenir picture
um what about this coming april
you don't have any festival
yah
yah
yah we don't have major festival in the month of april
so um uh we also like to go to singapore night safari
um can you tell me more about that eh
um how long um it will take for us to go there from the hotel that you gave it to u uh to the hotel that you gave it to me
yes
okay you will have to uh the mrt ride will take you approximately about forty five minutes to get to the northern part of singapore
and you will alight at the mrt train station called the ang mo kio station
and from there you change a bus number one three eight to get to the night safari
so it will be better for you to allocate at least about one and a half hours from the hotel to the night safari park
oh i see
so um in the night safari um what time the park will be open
the park will be open from uh seven thirty in the night time to twelve midnight
twelve midnight
yes
how much it will be um the entrance fee
the entrance fee will be thirty two dollars for an adult and a child will be twenty one dollars
that already include the tram ride
yes the tram ride is included uh for the uh price that i have quoted you
hm i see
that's great
um are we allowed to feed the animals or something
okay this is a wild park
that means the animals are not tame so uh yes we do not uh encourage anyone to feed the animals
they are well-taken care of uh by the zoo keepers
uh and they have uh regular feeding time
so we don't want the animals to put on too much weight
and they will be eating the wrong kind food if we give them the human food
so they have special uh food that the zoo keepers will feed them
so strictly no feeding
um and also uh we for the night safari because these animals most of the animals are nocturnal creatures
uh so if you're going to take photography uh on the animals then please switch off your um flashlights
oh i see
hm so fla the flash of to the camera is not allowed for when we take pictures
uh we do not uh want to damage the eyes of these uh nocturnal creatures because being nocturnal creatures they have very sharp uh eyesight
so we don't want to damage uh their eyes
and that's why we don't want any flash photographies on the animals
but if you want to take pictures of your friends or uh just the backdrop uh without the animals yes then you can take uh pictures with the flash
flash i see that great
um do you have any idea what is the highlights of the safari par uh the nig the safari
do you ha
hm yes the highlight of course eh some of the rarer animals that we don't get to see so close uh to us
i would be you see this tram ride
on the tram ride the malayan tapir comes very close to the tram right
but please keep all your any parts of your body to yourself
do not stretch them out
do not touch the animals because they are wild animals
so this is something interesting as well as and of course on the tram ride the deers will also come very close to the tram alright
so these are i would say interesting and highlight
um the other highlight would be the leopards that you can see up close uh to you
yah uh so you are actually just separated by the um leopards
yah by a glass enclosure okay
so you can see that on the screen now
they're so-close to the leopards and i think uh it's going to be a real highlight
okay
yes
cool
wow
le
yes
yah
wow that's great
yah
so you can see uh the spots alright
every spot of the leopard
uh so i think there are lot of nice uh animals that you can see but uh i would say uh personally for me i think these are very exciting
yes
yes i was actually i'm so excited right now
um my husband and i planning to go there on his birthday this coming april
so i'm looking forward to saw this leopard as well
yah
yes
but uh in order to see this leopard you will have to walk uh remember just now the tram ride
okay now when you are in the night safari you get on the tram ride
now in the middle of the tram ride there is a stop so you can get off and do a short walk for about thirty minutes and you get to see the leopard up close and personal
now when you finish this walk just come back to the main entrance and board another tram and that would bring you back to the main entrance
now again on the screen you can see there is fishing cat trail
if you're not too tired you can do this trail and the trail would take you about twenty minutes
and again the last trail it will be the forest giant trail right
so these are the three uh trails uh that you can do um for the uh tour over in the night safari
okay so it's up to you whether you are too tired you don't feel like walking on the tram ride you see seventy per cent of the animals
wow
yes
yah
wow
i don't think so that we'll be uh feel tired if ever that we go there
yes
yah
the thi i mean this is the first time um that we're planning to go to singapore
so i don't think so that we feel tired
so um uh um we also you also have a shows right
night shows
yes
we have a night shows at the um uh night safari park
we call it the creatures of the night show
okay
and um it's a different uh from a circus show
we'll just show you some of the animals that will be coming up
hm wow
wow lovely
alright
yes there you see the zoo keeper
alright bringing up not the uh lions
just the smaller animals uh for you to see uh a little bit closer alright
um so they will be just doing um what they normally do like feeding you know how do they uh take their food
um yah
so these are just things that they do
otherwise this is the fire show
uh it is comes on every night um and they will be performing at the front at the entrance of the night safari park
now to see the creatures of the night show normally it's a long queue uh so you have to queue there uh you have to be uh um at the queuing up for this show a little bit early
usually uh more than half an hours in advance
okay
oh wha more than hour in advance
yes
and so um that will only cost me again how much
okay their show is included
so uh if you want to see this show is they are all included in their admission ticket
okay the sh
so we also allowed to um uh what about in the show itself
are we allowed to touch um the small lion
uh no uh like i sa mention all the animals in the night safari park are wild animals
so only the zoo keepers allowed to touch them
oh only the zoo keeper
yes because they are still wild animals
so um in the spend tim i mean span time from six p.m. is that right
the night safari starts at seven thirty a
seven thirty
yes and it uh
until twelve midnight
twelve midnight yes
are we able to go there to all these uh beautiful spot that you show me
yes you uh from seven thirty to twelve midnight you definitely have a lot of time uh to see everything in the night safari park
but i don't uh you don't really need to stay until twelve p.m
i thought do we need to stay until twelve midnight
uh not necessary about three hours is already good enough
so it's enough
three hours is okay right
for three hours is actually uh enough uh to see everything in the night safari park
um but if it's um we go there for about seven thirty p.m. for three hours that will be around ten thirty
yes you can leave at about ten thirty
that is sufficient
is that safe to travel again to go back to the hotel
yes
uh ten thirty you can still take the public bus
uh one three eight back to the ang mo kio mrt train station and from there take uh um a train back to your hotel
now in singapore it's pretty safe to travel around in the night
but as usual anywhere else in the world you just avoid all the dark lanes um and do not uh carry too much cash with you that's all
alright
yes
but so that's great to hear
so um i will make sure that i will go the singapore night safari
okay and we have our latest of addition we have a baby giraffe that is just born
in our night safari
yah
wow
so how old this the giraffe
the giraffe is just a few months old
few months old
yah
still we're not allowed to carry them
uh no like i mention all our animals are wild animals
so uh it's not they are not tame at all
alright
so for this one um we only have three beautiful spots in singapore that we love to go to
do you have any idea or any suggestion that we can um as well to at least to i mean to go to as well
uh sorry what do you say
i mean do you have any suggestion that we um or do you have any idea that another spot in singapore that we can go to
um aside from singapore flyer in sentosa and sing in safari
do you have suggestion for us
okay do you do you like to do a little bit of sport extreme sport
like for example rock climbing
hm that's great
okay we have uh this rock climbing right in the heart of orchard road
it's called borderx
borderx
yes it's rock climbing
but it's on a wall actually
and you will be in a building
wow
borderx alright
and it's right in the heart of the shopping belt
do we have um safety gear for that
yes of course
you need safety gear to climb up this wall
okay this is borderx
okay i am showing you the location it's right in the heart of the orchard road
the mrt train station will be somerset station
okay now let me just try and show you the photograph of this borderx
this one lynnette is um we're going to climb a building right
yes uh a wall i would say
how a wall how tall is that
uh it's about three-story tall
again it depends on uh how is your fitness level
i don't think so that i can get there on the top
okay so yes we do have uh the trainers that will be uh teaching you how to climb at this wall alright
wow that's great
yah so this is yah just going to show you
how much is this
uh i mean how much it will cost us again for this um i think this is the best for me
and the if ever this is my first time that i will climb a wall
okay
uh it should be in the region of thirty four uh dollars
thirty four dollars
yes
are you quite fit
um maybe my partner
i don't think so that i can do that
okay
okay yes
now i'm showing you
you see they are climbing up this wall
hm that's great
okay it's thirty three dollars for the uh okay they just want to experience the climbing is twenty three for weekday and twenty eight uh for weekend
for weekends huh
uh yes and all the climbing gear the safety gear will all be provided
wow that's great
and that is open from
yah
so it's open from monday to friday uh one to ten p.m
okay
what about saturday and sunday
saturday sunday would be from eleven to ten p.m
oh that's great
so this is the wall
yah it's a thirty-metre vertical wall
hm i think it's hard to climb
okay i think you have to be a little bit fit for this
i don't think so
okay
so this is uh something that's exciting out here
yes
it's quite exci um what about the shoppi um the mall area
um are we allowed to um i mean what part of the singapore can we buy some souvenirs that we can bring home
okay
uh well if you like food because a lot of the local people like to eat out here
we have something uh quite interesting
it's a kind of cookie and inside you have this um pineapple um paste in there so it's called pineapple tarts
now all the other races the major races we cook this or we bake this pineapple tart
but all of us use a different recipe
so you'll be able to pick up this uh from the bakery shop they would have uh the pineapple tarts
otherwise if you enjoy meat okay like pork uh we have this barbecue pork slices uh so you can get them from this shop that specia or even you see them barbecuing meat it's marinated meat so it has that tinge of sweetness in a meat and you can buy them back home alright
some of them are vacuum packed as well so it's very easy for you to bring home uh to your country
wow
wow that's great
what about um an exotic food
yah
uh exotic like how exotic
oh li
crocodile meat
yes something like that
turtle meat
yes we do have them here
but of course you have to look specially for the restaurants
uh for turtle soup you will have to go to some of this uh non-air-conditioned coffee shops
uh where they serve this uh herbal turtle soup
coffee shop
um the what is the best um food that you can advice to us
well they have so many interesting food out here
so it's really difficult to talk about the best uh food
um so maybe can we be a little bit more specific
um i love heavy meal
more unique to singapore
sorry what did you like to have
uh i love heavy meal
heavy meal
yes
heavy meal
i love rice um meat fish
okay so you are a foodie uh
yes
okay maybe i will say uh things food that we have here in singapore that you don't readily get them in uh philippines right
maybe uh fried hokkien noodles
you can get them in our food centre whether air-conditioned or non-air-conditioned
so something that is easily available and i would say our majority of the local uh favourite food
fried hokkien noodle okay
so i'm going to give you this alright
so uh this is the let me just show you
wow
hm i see
hm that's great
so this is a fried hokkien fro uh fried hokkien prawn
yah it's actually with a bit of seafood like uh kara mani um okay
okay i'm gonna show you some of the food now
i think it's a little bit small here
so some
wow
yes okay now yah
this is fried hokkien noodles fried with prawn kara mani and it's yellow noodle and white noodle
okay so this is one i think you don't get them back home
okay yah
another yes you can see right
so it's tasty
yah its look delicious
yah
and another dish that i would like to recommend you will be fried carrot cake
this is a savoury food
okay it's savoury
it's actually white radish
you can see it's actually white radish um cooked with rice flour and that is the black version
it's has been cooked with black soya sauce black sauce
oh i see
black sauce
yah so it has a tinge of sweetness in there
the white colour will be savoury
so i don't think you get this food back home
so i like to just recommend you this two food and of course a lot more um uh food that we have
wow it's yes i love to try it actually
i'm hungry right now
yah so yah so it's not the normal uh orange carrot uh
it's actually white radish but we can call it the fried carrot cake
so a lot more uh um food that i recommend but like i said i think these are two just two recipes that you may not get them at home
two yah
but um i'm sure we will try that
yes
uh if you get from the uh non-air-conditioned food centre we call it hawker centre
one plate of this would cost you only three dollars
ah s
wow
yah
it's quite cheap
uh i mean three dollars for that um fried carrot cake
yes
yes
yah you can have it for either breakfast lunch or dinner
hm lovely
so um one more question
um what about um a bar or that we can go to
um that will be um of course uh we will love if it's um near in the hotel
okay now singapore is not that big
so everywhere you travel give yourself one hour is more than sufficient
generally it should be a travelling time about half an hour
okay there are so many clubs uh that are very good
uh again it depends on price range
so i will give you uh some of the clubs uh that you can do in singapore
uh huh yes
that's great
and also um much better if it's more affordable
okay
but most important uh they are very good clubs right
yes
okay this is a zouk alright it's a very famous in singapore
um it's just about half an hour uh distance uh travelling time for you
wow great
okay and uh the budget there it's well can range from forty to hundred dollars
it's a very good dance club
um next door there is uh the younger uh i would say the younger brother uh of zouk okay
so there are two clubs there that you can do
otherwise you can go to saint james powerstation
okay there are three clubs here zouk phuture and devil underground
uh you can also go to saint james powerstation
there are quite a few clubs there as well
wow
okay
so you want something more affordable right
yes
because of course uh we need to um budget the money that we have
okay this is an entertainment complex
um so there are quite a few clubs there uh that you can uh do
clubs
that's great
what about the entrance fee um do they have entrance fee
yes they do have
so generally out there okay it's a bit noisy now i'm going to turn off this
okay now uh there are entrance fee so again it depends on which particular club you want to go to
over at saint james it range from about forty dollars up to a hundred
uh then of course there more expensive club uh world famous like uh ku dé ta uh that's over at marina
you're familiar with this club
um actually no
okay
so maybe is something a little bit more affordable would be this club
okay let me give you this
wow that's great
so the best um beverage in singapore um that we would love to taste it um can you give me um any suggestion for that
uh are you talking about alcoholic or non-alcohol
yes alcoholic
alcoholic okay
for alcohol uh we have a very good selection of wines uh from all over the world
um from shiraz pinot noir
okay so really hard to pinpoint
so we have so many uh variety uh of uh wine here in singapore
okay cocktail-wise again a very good selection and in fact some of the clubs that you're gonna visit they would have their own concoction
so really difficult
but one of our local uh cocktail yes
uh that would be the singapore sling
wines
wow
local yes
singapore sling
singapore gin sling yes
gin sling
uh it's locally concocted
um so it's a little mild kind of a cocktail drink pink in colour
wow
yah so that is something uh that is local um otherwise a very good selection of wine and like i said cocktail
so it's going to be too wide uh to let you know like which uh cocktail to recommend to you
recommend
but i think um i would love to um try um for the singapore sling gin
yah
yes it's a gin sling uh that would be something that is locally concocted
uh yah
so the other club that i recommend you which is a little bit cheaper would be double o. okay that is at queen street
yah
double o. and wow that's great
that will be a little bit uh cheaper
okay unfortunately i don't think the website is on
okay let see whether this okay yup this is double o
double o
yah so it will be a bit cheaper compared to zouk
okay
i think zouk is first class right
alright
yes it's a well-known club
uh a lot of um tourist uh local likes to visit this club
oh i see that's great
yah
so this one i think it's more affordable than the zouk right
yah this is like cheaper
wow that's great
that's great to hear
yah
so you can do two clubs alright
one per night
yah
that's great to hear lynnette
so um i think i have all the information that i need
um thank you or all your help
right
okay thank you for calling and uh we hope to see you in singapore soon
oh i see that's great to hear
so um i also would like to meet you as well
okay see you then
alright bye
alright bye
hi good morning
this is tour guide number one
and this is lynnette
hi good morning
this is participant number twenty four and this warren
warren
yup
hi warren
hi
oh the reason why i'm calling is i want to go ont into singapore and could you help me
sure
but uh maybe you can you give me a little bit of detail as to uh what you would like uh to do or see uh out here or what are your interest
and i would be able to recommend you the correct uh things
alright
hm well actually i have no idea hm where to go in singapore
but can you give me at least five to ten hottest places there
okay
hot as in hotspots like uh the dance clubs
yup uh i mean the
so you are
tourist i mean hotspot tourist destination there in singapore
okay
uh but do you have special interest
oh for ex um i love to go into beach mountains and like theme parks
hm historical places like that
okay sure
alright
i will start with uh
okay i will start with let say uh you're talking about mountains
yup
well we do not have mountains in singapore
uh but what we have would be uh bukit timah hill
it's not very difficult to climb
bukit timah
so maybe hill
oh bukit timah hill okay
yah
now bukit timah hill i'm just going to show you some images of the bukit timah hill
okay and this is just a hill
um it's a nice walk up uh in the morning you get to meet some of the local quite a lot of the local like to climb this hill as well
um and it's basically a very easy walk
but of course if you want a more challenging walk up the hill then you can do the trail
alright but please do not get off uh the normal walking trails
yes and you get to see of course some of these um bir butterflies uh flora and fauna and you see all these people enjoying themselve climbing up the hill
yah
oh i get it
okay
you see i got the view in here
yes
so it's quite a nice walk
you can do a relaxing uh walk up or you can do uh a more challenging up you know with all these steps up this hill
and of course there are some monkeys that you will see along the way
okay
so this is the bukit timah hill
um but mountain climbing like i said we don't have mountains here this is only a hill
so this is one of the uh items that i would like to recommend you
but of course again if you want something a little bit more challenging we do have a weight uh sorry
uh cable ski in the uh eastern part of singapore
we have this uh cable skiing out there
as well as the beach uh over on the eastern part of singapore
oh so
so
okay
oh hm
oh may so how long it will take if from singa from airport singapore to in that place
uh which place
the bukit timah hill
oh actu
okay uh yup
uh as much as possible i'll try to minimise my time travel here because uh may be one day two-day so i could yes
that's the only days that i could go there
right
uh okay
but uh you are going to stay uh that means somewhere convenient for you to travel to all these places right
okay what i would like to recommend you to stay would be well since you sounds a little bit like a more adventurer person well you can uh do you mind staying in a backpackers hotel
oh okay so i mean eh is that not expensive right
yes it's not expensive
you could get uh a bed space uh for as cheap as less than fifty dollars singapore dollars
uh twenty five dollars alright
and they are quite a lot of this backpackers uh hotel
uh and a few of them in fact quite a number of them are located in very good co uh locations
you are just about five ten minutes walk to the mrt the subway
oh great
wow
good
alright yah
how about the uh other places for examples the beach
okay
uh the beach
uh east coast we do have beaches out there but uh the sand there will not be like totally small white sand
uh no we don't have that kind of sand out on the mainland
uh it's just a place where the local people chill out over the weekend
um do a sport of fishing
uh otherwise the better waters would be in our southern islands or on sentosa islands
wow
oh really
okay
so we have
i saw it
um hm say go on
talk a little bit
um and i like to if we go back to just now uh sports right
i wanted to actually show you uh the another sport that you can do uh the other water sports that you can do out here like cable skiing
yes
oh i know that
i tried that before in the philippines
okay and how about uh something uh
wakeboarding do you have that
wakeboarding yes we have that as well
yup
i mean um how much can i pay for that
okay let me just uh
i guess
okay that would be the eastern part of singapore
okay
uh it's around thirty over dollars
okay
yah
do you have you done that over in philippines
yes
um in camsur there is wakeboarding competition there before
uh most of the surfer around the asian and some australian people go there and compete
okay
as i have the of course the beach
one of the coolest place in the southern part in singapore right
uh like eastern part right
yes we yes
eastern part we have the east coast and changi beach
east
changi beach
uh yes
uh but they are just simple beaches you know
nothing to worry
yes
and uh then otherwise if you want uh the nicer beach that would be at the uh sentosa or to take a boat to the southern islands
yes then you get uh the nicer uh beach out there
ah okay
oh um tell me about the uh another thing is historical places
okay
uh so i don't have to rec do you want me to still recommend you some extreme sport here or we go straight to the historical places
uh no the sports first
of course this uh sport first
sports first
okay now this one you are looking at is the uh we have like the extreme swing
uh we also have the reverse bungee jump
okay
yah so and yes i'm scrolling down for you to see
okay
now this is uh i don't know whether is it too small for you to see border x
oh yah well that's fine with me
okay
now this is indoor uh rock climbing and it's right in the heart of uh orchard
okay
the next sport will be uh the cable ski and also wakeboarding that's in the east coast of singapore
wow
right
next one extreme uh swing and this is something quite new is ifly
so you are defying gravity
i wanna try that one
yah
okay this is on sentosa alright
so in the war uh sky diving uh stimulator
hm nice
yah
this is something interesting
very interesting alright
okay the price will be eighty nine dollars uh for an adult
oh eighty nine dollars
not bad
yah but it's uh well you can't get it in a lot of places right
okay so that's the wakeboarding that you are talking about
the next one and i think you may find uh okay and we have also the extreme skate park over here in the east coast
and so that gives you a lot of uh excitement interesting things to do
this is a free admission huh
but of course you are to bring your own skate
they provide you only with the uh hardware
okay
oh i see the oh i see
do you yah i try uh i wanna try this one to the ultimate drive
wow driving with different the using ferrari car
yah so you can oh that one
uh that one only comes in the uh f1
uh yah
how much is that cost
okay
now this is a street circuit
okay it's uh two hundred and forty eight dollars
i have one oh by the way as the cost of this i mean using the ferrari car how much it will cost
uh sorry what did you say
i mean how much i'm gonna pay for using a uh driving a ferrari car
oh okay
yah this is the prices over here
oh i se three hundred thirty nine
yah on your right-hand side yes
oh uh uh
uh yah three ninety eight dol
sixty-minute will be uh six hundred over dollars
uh thirty minutes three hundred and ninety six
and if you just do the street circuit that's two hundred and forty eight doll
wow
wow
it's too expensive for me
okay
yah just okay i think the earlier on the uh this ultimate skate park that is free
uh ifly i think it's still very reasonable considering that it's very really exciting to do that
um and i think borderx is still very affordable as well
okay so these are things that you may want to consider to do uh when you are in singapore
so borderx it's conveniently located it's in orchard road
ski and um the ski cable ski is on the east coast so you could do that together with uh sport of swimming in the east coast area or changi area
now um ifly would be on sentosa island
so in case you're going to sentosa island for a swim or to do the theme park you could do that huh
uh wakeboarding it's somewhere near the southern part of singapore
and uh this one yes you could combine again with sentosa alright
now again the skate park you could combine that with the uh swim over at the east coast area and the cable ski
alright
because they are located in the same location
okay so we uh so you have lots and lots of things excitement to do um uh for the extreme sport
wow
wow alright
wow
alright
thanks for the info
um uh okay let's go to another hot tourist spot there
uh let me how about the historical places
can you give me some
okay
ah okay
can you give me some
right
we have a few historical places uh in singapore
um are you talking about ethnic historical places
yes
okay of course uh we have closer to uh the orchard belt area we have chinatown
and aside chinese
this is chinatown
oh i see
okay
i know pretty sure that there's a lot of activities in chinatown right
yes
uh more activities you see a lot more in chinatown uh sometime during the january period
uh otherwise yes it's a nice uh um a walk along some of the different uh uh different uh lanes of chinatown
uh it's so of course you see the traditional houses that's flashed on your screen now
you can get uh very typical chinese food uh in chinatown
so do try uh one of our very local chicken rice um fried hokkien noodles fried carrot cake and of course something that you can bring home would be the barbecue uh meat slices
and some of them comes in vacuum pack and it's very easy for you to bring home
and so how much can i pay for that
uh for the barbecue pork slices
yap
okay normal prices uh excluding the chinese new year period you can even get one piece uh for fifty cents
yes and it goes according to the weight
oh i se
so it can uh cost you like thirteen dollars or twelve dollars for one kilogram
wow
yah so you can buy a few pieces which you just want it or just to uh for people to try one piece of uh barbecue pork slices would be a quarter of our uh laptop slice
yah
ah okay
what else
okay so that's chinatown
uh we do have a very interesting museum called the chinatown heritage centre
oh so what can i see there
okay
now uh over in the chinatown heritage centre you will see how people use to live in the past alright
i'm just showing you some of their gallery pictures out here
ah okay
okay so you see how people used to live in the past because uh a lot of chinese when they first came a lot of them were illiterate so they could not speak or write english and neither not every one of the chinese could speak or write mandarin
they would be speaking in their local dialect
and since they were not skilled workers as well they didn't have much money
so they will just book or rent a bed space in all these chinatown houses
so we can see how uh what kind of living conditions they were living in um in the uh chinatown heritage centre
okay so uh this is the chinatown uh heritage centre yah
just a few uh gallery photos for you to see
it's located right in the heart of chinatown
and it also nears in airport right
okay
orch yah orchard yes
it is pretty near because uh singapore is not so big
uh so everywhere uh that you are going travel uh approximately half an hour to one hour it's fine uh if you're taking the public uh transportation
well good to hear that
there is i don't need to spend a lot of time travelling to different places there
okay
yes
yes
so the admission charges is ten dollars for an adult and six dollars for a child for a visit to the chinatown heritage centre
so in chinatown you uh don't just walk around the um lanes but look into some of these uh still traditional shops
so they do have some interesting uh things that they sell
do also look out for uh some chinese pastry shop uh that you don't see them in the modern confectionery
so very typical uh chinese pastry
uh and something that's very interesting would be a round kind of cake called the mooncake
uh normally yah
okay
i heard that moon cake
i wanna try that too
so yes you can get that even if you come any time of the year
okay it's uh sweet
uh it's a chinese pastry and of course we normally eat this food during the mooncake festival
and so when it will be happen again fo in this year
okay at this year it will happen in the month of september
oh wow september
oh not bad
yah so this is the uh mooncake festival
and of course in this during this festival a lot of the people okay i'm gonna show the images of the mooncake festival
okay you can see this is mooncake
alright
yah uh traditionally of course it should be brown and inside the mooncake it is filled up with lotus paste
but now uh with the modern um uh influences you can even have uh all sorts of filling from uh durian uh to egg custard chocolate blueberry mooncake alright
and of course during this festival at it's uh eg uh together with this festival we also carry or rather the children would carry the lanterns
so you can see some of these lanterns here
wo
so how long it will take i mean the festival
it will take a one week
the festival itself is just one day yah
so i think
oh one day festival okay
yes it's just for the one day festival
but uh prior to this festival uh people would be shopping uh for mooncake to eat during the mooncake festival
this is a chinese festival
uh there are quite a few legends associated with this festival
can see the next picture here
this is the lantern the traditional lantern
alright
okay
so this is uh yes you can still get to eat mooncake uh anytime of the year
uh there's a shop on uh chinatown called sago uh lane
uh the shop there sells mooncake throughout the whole year
yah
alright good
um so how about the singapore historical places
aside from uh the chinatown
in your culture
yes chinatown i have showed you right
at the uh chinatown some of the pictures and what you can do over in chinatown
the other historical ethnic area would be kampong glam
what's that
okay
now kampong glam is traditionally where the indi uh the malays uh the arabs use to live in the past um and of course it gives you that um malay influence
as you can see from the houses here they are a little bit different from the chinatown houses
uh there are carvings on the outside of the houses but um you won't see a live uh creatures compared to the ones in chinatown
yes you do see live creatures
but the ones here would be mainly geometric or um a plants uh flowers kind of design uh on the facade of the building
the highlight would be the southern mosque okay
and these are walking street in kampong glam
is that not big
i mean it's not big place right
and this no it's uh just a few street uh and you can walk
uh you can easily finish kampong glam in two hours
and since you're there don't forget to try some malay food
uh for example some of the malay food would be uh mee siam mee rebus nasi padang that means nasi is rice rice with different dishes
so you can try that
is that the spicy food
uh yes generally the malay cuisine uses a lot more spices compared to the oth
wow
i like that spicy foods
yes
you like spicy food
okay
and you can eat with your hands if you are trying malay food
oh i'm gonna do that
okay so again some more scenes for you wa uh to see um over in the kampong glam area
now if you are going to kampong glam uh i would like to introduce you to this quite funky street call um uh haji lane
okay
i mean what i can see in that place
okay
uh there are quite a few home-grown shops out there and they sell quite uh funky trendy kind of uh
yes
different accessories dress something like that
yes shirts and other interesting cafés out there as well
and in a low price right
yah
um yes i would not say that they are the branded ones
but this is just some of the street scenes over in this lane huh
okay so and of cause the shops uh you can find them in the shopping mall
oh it's quite a colourful street out here
okay this is haji lane out here
uh most of there selling there is a cheap right
and this uh low price
uh well i wouldn't say the prices are like a dollar two dollars but uh it is very different as you can see from the fashion here alright
you don't get them from the normal um uh shopping competitors
oh um hm i get it
alright
yes um so i would say it's different
okay it's trendy uh and the most of this are own by young entrepreneurs
uh so i'm just showing you some of the street scene in haji lane alright
ah i see
ah great
alright
hm what else
i mean i heard that um singapore has a universal studio right
uh yes
oh could i also uh let you know we have one more ethnic area in singapore
oh sure
okay
and what it's called
we call this little india
oh little india okay
it's not that far right
uh no it's not far you it's also accessible
it's pretty near to kampong glam actually
so if you don't mind taking a walk uh about twenty minutes at little india okay
okay so again some of the scene here that you see in little india very colourful
and again if you like spicy food you can try um a size a spicy food and try eating uh chapatti roti prata with your hands
i got no
wow
or even a malay dish call briyani uh
briyani
yes it's a coloured rice
uh eh with chicken mutton right
and you can have that meal uh famous in store in little india
okay and you were talking about universal studio
right
yup
were you just mentioning about universal studio earlier on
yah i just mention it because i have heard that before that there is a universal studio in singapore
yah just so i just wanna know a little bit information on that
maybe i could pass there and check it out
okay
pass there
yah
i could check i mean i could pass and go there and check it
okay
okay universal studio is a theme park
it is uh located in sentosa
okay
now you can see this uh rollercoaster
very exciting
ah i see
wow
and some pictures of what you will see in universal studio
okay
oh i mean
and of course you see there are seven areas of universal studio
okay i need ro reduce for only for one day
do you think
reduce one day
yah
do you think
sorry
do you think i can
you just want to spend one day in singapore
uh no i mean do you think i can tour this universal studio for only for one day
yes you can
you can finish all the rides in one day uh for universal studio
oh i see
i i thought i cannot finish it
can
possible
it's possible to finish it up all the rides in one day
oh i see
oh good
because that park will be open uh from ten a.m. to nine p.m. so no problem
you can finish all the rides
wow
yah
uh how much i mean how much the entrance there if i go to
the admission
um hm the admission
to the universal studio
yup
okay for uh adult it's sixty eight dollars uh for uh not uh weekday
weekend will be seventy four dollars
and the child will be fifty dollars and um weekends would be fifty four dollars
hm good
so if you're thinking of doing the universal studio and since earlier on you indicated that you also like to try the ifly uh the ifly is on sentosa island
oh so i could drop by this too after i go to
yes so you could do these two activities uh in one day
yah great good
um what else um
um what else um
beach mountain universal studio ethical places um may
okay
beach
yup
uh beach
uh just now yes you also mentioned about beaches
yup
uh we do have uh i would say uh better beaches out on sentosa island
so you could easily spent two days come back again the next day and do your beaches the beach on sentosa island
alright
okay
oh good
aside from the of course the theme park do you have any hm how'd you call it
um what you call it by the way
theme park uh
uh no other than theme park
food
yah yes i mean delicacies food
yah i forgot it
oh whether there is food available in the theme park
what uh no i mean can you give me some example of a delicacies of the singaporean people
i just wanna know about it
do you have any idea
yah of course hold on
okay delicacy
chilli crab
oh chilli crab
so usually i mean all the tourists there um eat chilli pot
well if for people who don't mi uh who like spicy food because chilli crab is definitely spicy okay
so these are uh chilli crabs different recipes of chilli crab
and uh this is something that a lot of the locals like to eat
so yes i would say chilli crab will be something hm very unique to singapore or the other version would be pepper crab
uh chili crab okay
pepper crab okay
so i can buy any
i ca i just uh i can buy res can buy it in any restaurant there right
yes most of the seafood restaurant would be able to cook for you uh pepper crab or um uh chili crabs
chilli crab
^um hm. but it's not that expensive too
yah
right
it's not that expensive
they normally uh the price will be charged according to the size and the weight the weight of the crabs
so while before you even order uh ask the uh restaurant to give you the pricing first
so generally one crab uh a medium size crab would cost you about um twenty dollars
so if you have uh just two of you one crab is enough
oh i see that big one
i don't know if i could
yah
yah these are yes it not that tiny
so yes you do get a fair bit of flesh
uh so yes the restaurant will tell you
first you tell them you know to let you know the price first uh like how much roughly it's going cost you if you order one you order two because it's quite hard to tell you the exact price because the price are priced according to weight of the crab for seafood
so they price it accordingly
wow
this is uh pepper crab
again different uh recipes of uh pepper crab out here
okay so this is uh something a lot of people like to eat
uh i believe you got durians in philippines
yup we do have
do you like durian
yah okay
so this yes we do like durians out here
uh okay so now another kind of food that you may like to consider would be a
hm what else
okay
so this is another food uh that you may like to eat
okay this is oyster omelette
is it
oops
wow
you are hungry now right
i'm going to show you so many images of food
yes i'm hungry now
yes
yah
it's uh egg uh cooked with or rather oyster cooked with egg
so it's actually uh oyster omelette
wow
again you can eat them from uh major i mean from most of our food centre air-condition non air-condition or even restaurants chinese restaurant they offer this um uh to uh the guest
wow i wanna taste that
i wanna eat that
yes
yah so we have a lot of option in terms of food huh
so if you want to try all the food in singapore you probably have to stay a few years here
yes uh definitely you're correct about that
hm what else
um what else
can you give me some more exciting places
and i wanna do every adventure there when i while i'm gonna stay there
okay so we have uh covered all the uh sport uh earlier on right
okay um do you want to do a bit of kite flying over in singapore
oh sure
definitely i love to do that
okay we can do because the wind there is very good and a lot of uh people do kite flying out there
uh some of them do this mechanical kite flying over at the uh marina barrage
wow that is the first time that i heard mechanical fly kite
right
yes
yah that is the first time that i heard that
okay so this is the place
yes you can see all these kites out there
okay yes they are driving kites
and uh well they are mechanical some of them are mechanical uh operated kind of kites
it's not the traditional uh kite
oh i see
so this is done at the marina barrage
oh i see
oh what's that parachute by the way
what you call that
oh why do we go there to fly kites
okay because uh you get a very good sc uh view you can see the landmarks behind
uh these are the financial district of singapore and here you can see a little bit of the water here
this is at the marina bay
and the wind is usually very strong out there so at any time of the day you see people flying kites out there
wow
okay what you need to do is if you don't have kites you can buy it over there or you can bring your own kites there and fly your kite
okay so this is the kite flying uh over at the marina barrage
wow great
there you can see lots of people flying kites out there
okay so anytime uh of uh the day alright
hm alright
now you see these three towers here
this is the marina bay sands resort
if you just like to have a little bit uh try your luck i guess
you can go into the casino
uh that's located in the basement of the marina bay sands resort
i see
okay if you want to have a good view of the southern part of singapore as well as the south china sea you can a take ride up to the cantilever
uh on top of the marina bay sands resort incurred a very good view up there
uh do i have to pay the entrance for that or
yes that will cost you twenty dollars
up to go up there
okay and there is a very good uh dance club up there as well it's world famous
it's a famous uh club
wow
the night which means the nightlife is there is pretty real live
you have that's right
or if you don't want you can just go there and just have a good view um uh of uh a very good view
three hundred sixty five view of uh singapore
wow
i wanna try that too
yah well there's a lot of things you wanna do that you can do yah in singapore
okay so this is the kite flying over at the marina bay
you can see there a big kites out there
okay big
yah
i guess i gonna do that for one to two days
i guess i need to go back every month just to
yes every month you will have to come for two days
or you can also make it a longer trip
uh is to tour yes
but i can't do uh well i always busy by weekdays only by weekends i can only drop by in singapore
oh okay
yah
so yah
so these are some of all the will you be interested in war museums
oh yes
well it's always on around the city right
so i ca
uh we have a quite few war museums all over uh various parts of singapore
and
but but if it but it will not take a long for i mean two to three hours drive
uh no yes
uh like i mention everywhere you go in singapore will probably take you only uh half an hour to one hour if you are taking the public transport
no
oh uh good to hear that
uh at least i can do a lot of things within less than an hour
huh
yes and uh some of the museums are not that big
you probably can spend one hour if you don't have much time uh two hours would be most ideal for most of our museum
so uh there are war museums um if you are doing sentosa you can come by this museum together because uh it is just about two bus stop and you have to just walk up a hill call kit chandu
so what do you call that museum
uh it's called bukit chandu
reflections at bukit chandu
oh bukit chandu
okay
thanks
uh so how much the entrance for that
okay just give me a minute
okay i'm sorry
you said before that there are three museum
sorry
you said before that there are three museum that i can go right
three museum
yup
or there are some few museum that i can check
yes there are few museums you can check
so uh i'm giving you in terms of location
so let say if you are doing the ifly the um universal studio on sentosa island then you could do this museum because they are in the uh southern part of singapore
uh you know because you also mention that you don't want to spend too much time travelling
so they are in like basically the same location so you could this museum
it's a good museum and there is a show inside the museum
uh but basically this museum uh shows you uh the last battle of singapore at the southern part of singapore
and uh last uh that area is the defended by the uh malay regiment of singapore
so that was a very fierce battle that was fought in the southern part of singapore
so at this particular building um uh and around the hill area that was the last battle just before singapore surrender
are
uh universal studio um hm
hm uh yap
alright
great
so yes
again if you are going to sentosa we have another museum there
uh it's called fort siloso
fort siloso
fort siloso
it also the around in sentosa
yah walking
yes it's on sentosa
so again you know you easily can spend a number of days just on sentosa
so i'm going to show you some images of fort siloso
uh this one will be the wax uh figure showing you the surrender of singa uh of the japanese to the allied forces in nineteen forty five
and this one here will be the surrender of the british to the japanese in nineteen forty three alright
so it shows you the war um that happened uh on in sentosa alright
uh so how much the entrance for that
how much do i cost if i
okay uh okay this one the entrance is ten dollar
oh ten dollars
hm okay
yah
and the you show that the other museum that you said how much the entrance for that
uh that is also ten dollars
ah the same
yes
okay but again it depends on what you want to see
if you just want to see the last battle or do you want to see like more of the uh artefacts that were used uh alright there's one here
this is on uh fort siloso
okay
yes so i'm just showing you images of the fort siloso
this museum it's uh some parts of it are open air
uh whereas the other one would be a indoor kind of a museum
wow
so we are talking about different uh focus of war uh for this uh two museum
and of course there are lot more other museums
so i just uh recommend you this two uh for the time being
yes
hm what else
so you have been doing a lot of uh well i have recommended you a lot of exciting things to do
do you want to tone down things a little bit
yah sure
actually i like to try to organise my tour when i so when i go there at least i could go or i mean i could tour a lot of places in maybe a few days
uh expent in sen inspect in sentosa well i guess i could go to into two different museum also the beach and the on
i uh what you call that
the i
right
ifly
yah the ifly and the universal studio
well i guess i can do that for i guess two to three days right
yah
uh yes you could do all these yes in two to three days
um because besides the attraction that we talk about there are other attractions like the other parks uh images uh there's a museum also another museum showcasing the history of singapore
uh so again yes easily two to three days
so like i said you just have to shortlist you know
and what are the things that you want to do
oh okay
uh how about i mean i'm just curious about the expenses of the rooms like if i
the the what
yah the hotels
the hotel okay
so we were talking that you don't mind uh backpackers hotel right
yah
okay we have a backpackers hotel
quite a lot of them actually

okay
oh no problem

oh i see
you still can't walk to the beach uh even though we have some backpackers hotel in the east
alright
uh would i be able to recommend you this hotel call sleepy sam
sleepy sam out here
okay it has very good review and it's right in the heart of the heritage area of kampong glam
ten minutes walk to the mrt train station
okay
so this is uh one of the backpackers hotel and just like i said it's a good review out here
okay another one will be betel nut
yah
i hope that's not that expensive
and i
no they are like i mention it's between twenty over dollars uh to fifty dollars
yah

okay
yes so yes then you could do a lot more uh things
but this is a youth hotel
it's call the betel uh box uh hostel

okay
okay yah
this is the uh hotel

so i'm just giving you some of the uh since you wanted the a uh what do you call that
a cheaper rate of hotel so that you could spend um your money you know doing all the extreme sport
uh yah
alright
so these are also city backpackers
hostel these are hostel as well

i guess there is okay
uh it's near the just about ten minutes from the financial district area
we have uh world famous ku dé ta that's at the uh marina bay sands resort
something a little bit cheaper would be double o. okay that's at the queen street area
uh if you like local bands we have uh a club call home
oh uh they are all located near in sentosa
yah
uh no uh the club on sentosa uh no really like uh dance club on sentosa
we have just drinking places
oh i see
yah so there are drinking places by the beach uh that serve wine cocktail soft drinks
uh but the bands you will have to go back to mainland
hm i see
well it will
so what kind of music do you like
um hip-hop local bands
yes our hip well sometimes i love hip-hop and r and b but most of the time i like listen acoustics
acoustic music um hm
hip-hop
just acoustic
home-grown
yah
yup home-grown
okay we have uh club that does uh local bands
it's called home
us i mean it's well i guess that bar isn't it that bar is not expensive
no it's not so expensive
okay
well the location i don't think i have the pictures for you to see
uh but this is uh located um just at uh boat quay area
the southern part of singapore
so there are quite a few uh bars and clubs uh located uh around the clarke quay area
and the actua uh the street name will be called the riverwalk
wow
okay so if you are talking about hip-hop then it will be butter factory
do i need tour guide in here
do i need the tour guide
okay this is uh hip-hop sorry
oh no you don't need the tour guide for your uh clubbing right
just grab a few friends and you're done
or well there are always uh like-minded people over in all these clubs
so this is uh hip-hop and r and b
yah
so again they are all located in very centralised uh area uh in singapore
wow
okay dress code uh just club fashion
clubbing there
oh good
um what else um what else do i need to do in singapore
give me so
gi can you give me some ideas
wow a lot of things that you have to do here
okay just to tone down things a little bit
uh you can do this uh very uh relaxing cruise on the singapore river
yah
yup
for how many hours
i mean it's an hour
uh just an half an hour ride
oh i see
um i mean how much uh i had to pay for that
uh that would be fifteen dollars
oh good
uh i thought it will be cost in hundred
uh no no i think your most expensive cost that you'll be spending here will probably be your clubbing i think right
yes
uh that i gues i will gonna buy some one bottle of beer and that's it
no need to buy a lot of beers then
oh dear
okay so this is the just to tone down things a little bit
uh you can just take a river cruise
uh that would cost you fifteen dollars along the uh okay along the singapore river
okay
oops
okay just give me a minute
it also have night cruise right
uh yes you can take anytime of the day we have this cruise
just about half an hour ride on the uh singapore river
wow
oh it is the same right
in morning or in the evening
uh yes the price is the same but of course we are looking at uh different scenery
okay you are just looking at different scenery
uh in the night time uh you get to see the lights and there's a commentary on the cruise itself
uh like i said you know since you are going to do so much exciting things in singapore so we just tone down things a little bit
if you still have the time uh and energy then you just go for a river cruise on the singapore river
yes definitely
okay
okay yes
what else
okay you'll be seeing this uh and this is the boat
let me show you the boat
yah uh it's used to ferry goods in the past uh this kind of boat
wow
alright
i don't know whether you see this boat out there
and the buildings behind is actually is boat quay
so if you are taking in the daytime this cruise then of course it's a totally different kind of scenery
the night cruise when all the lights comes on and again a different view of uh singapore on the river itself
huh
wow
i guess that's it
okay
you give me a lot of information that it helps me a lot
yah so you have to come back a few times huh not just one okay
yes uh not just one time
because maybe four to five times in one year just to tour around singapore
yah
yes
otherwise you can't finish everything that you want to do here
well i guess that's it
thanks a lot
thank you so much
welcome
alright so we hope to see you in singapore soon
hopefully
thank you so much
have a great day
bye
alright
welco okay same to you
bye
hello
hello
good afternoon
i am jeanne
guide number two
hi jeanne
good afternoon
um i'm participant number thirty
my name is dodie victor
uh number thirteen
how do you spell your name
is it d o d y
um no that's actually d as in delta o oscar d i e
oh d o d i e. and your number three zero is that right
that's correct
uh huh dodie
how can i help you dodie
alright
hi
so jeanne i was actually looking forward to um visit a country in the southeast asian region
and i'm currently considering singapore
um i wonder if you can help me out
yes of course
you need to first you sound like a young man are you
um i'm actually thirty four years old
relatively young
but i'm not really that young
yes
very young
uh how many people will be travelling with you
um it's just going to be me and my fiancée
okay
and your fiancé would be the same age as you right
that's correct
okay
uh when are you intending to travel
um we will be having a holiday week soon in the philippines
so i'm looking forward to travel um first week of april
that's the easter weekend right
um that's correct
can you give me the exact dates of arrival and departure
hm yes
i'm looking forward to leave manila um on thursday and so it most likely be thurs the same day
and um i'm thinking of staying at least a day or two
okay
uh what are your interest
um yah
so yah that's another good question
um i'm actually into sporting activities
but i don't mind going to places in singapore that are um already popular to a lot of tourists that go there
so um i'd like to hear first what you have to say um about the destinations most people would like to go to
um and then i probably consider it um or not if i think that it doesn't fit my preferences then i'd let you know uh if i can also visit some other activities like a basketball game uh if there is something that will be done or happening on that same day that i'll go there
okay
so you do you would like to watch a game in process uh while you are in singapore and also visit some attractions is that right
that is correct
yes
okay first uh maybe we select a hotel for you and uh i show you a map of singapore and so you know what's the location of uh the various places
okay
so this is this should be the primary destination right
for most tourists
yes
this is um when you come in from the airport
i'm sorry
could you say that again
when you come in from the airport you will land at changi airport which is in the eastern side of singapore
you know singapore isn't very large
seven hundred square kilometres
so okay
so this is a portion of the map that's interesting that is enlarged
uh do you see number three here at the right-hand side
uh that's the eastern corner of singapore
and the various colours you see are the lines for the mass rapid transit
uh so it shows you the connectivity
so from changi airport if you follow the green line down and you end at outram park you can go to the harbourfront which and it's across from an island called sentosa just opposite
uh and if you go the other way you are into chinatown a little bit further up
dhoby ghaut is a major interchange where you see three little circles
so three lines pass through there
and so if you take the northeast uh sorry the north-south line the red line you will reach orchard road which is a major shopping and tourist belt
alright
right
yah i do
okay
right
right
these are all interesting spots however um i've heard of sentosa before um and i've heard from my friends who've actually been to singapore and have been to sentosa that it's a relatively expensive place to be and the budget that i'd like to allocate for this trip would about uh a thousand singaporean dollars
uh sentosa uh has got many attractions
so you need not uh use up a lot of money if you for example see a show that's and you don't buy the top end tickets and in fact if you only go to the beach it will cost you only three dollars
because there is no entry fee to the beach
two dollars to go in one dollar for the bus shuttle
oh
oh interesting
but whether on the island if you want to visit attractions then it's uh whichever attraction you pick uh it has a fee
hm so what are the top uh attractions in sentosa
okay
first uh can i you want me to pick you a hotel first
oh um sure
oh um sure
but um uh since i'm actually currently interested in sentosa
so it there a hotel nearby
uh if you stay in chinatown you can get to harbourfront and you can get to the island very quickly
the hotels on the island would be a little bit pricier because they are you know normal hotels uh on resort islands
so uh of the top of per head about two hundred over dollars
in chinatown you can get them for around a hundred or even less
and you can also stay in the heritage area known as little india
and if you come out of there
to eat breakfast lunch or dinner or pick up a midnight snack lots of such food in little india and chinatown
uh if you are at on sentosa you probably have to go to the uh restaurants along the beach or eat at the hotels
so it will add to the cost
right
the wow
okay
yah
so um yah you mentioned that i have to stay in chinatown get a hotel in there before i go to sentosa
so is that something that i have to do by foot or do i actually have to reserve a vehicle for transportation
uh you don't really have to stay in chinatown
i'm just giving you choices
so if you stay in chinatown you've got more money to spend elsewhere
yah that's a good option for me
so hm okay
so back to our map here
uh when you land at changi airport uh at the basement is the train line uh station
and you go and see the officer and you buy what we call an ezlink card uh with a stored value and you can get a refund on the unused portion when you leave
so this would be a very fast and inexpensive way to get into town
a lots of tourist use it
s you would not be bringing a huge bag right
so uh you can
uh hm okay
um yes it's gonna be overnight
so just a few clothes shirts and pants
yah that's right
so you take the train and the nice thing is it's above ground
so you're getting a better view than if you are say in a taxi or you know walking
anyway you wouldn't walk to town
it's a bit far
it goes above ground right up to kallang and then it goes under ground
so this mass rapid transit is partially above ground where there are space and partially underground
so you take it down to outram park and then you can switch to the purple which is the northeast line
can you see it
interesting
yes
and one
i can see it
yah one stop you are in chinatown
okay
okay so um i'm not gonna miss it right
um there are lots of signs um that i can actually use as reference if i need to get off somewhere
will i have a guide
will i u actually use a bo mobile phone to contact someone
the no you don't need to
um the stations will have signs and there will be an announcement on the trains before you get off
okay good
so you just you know prepare yourself when you are at tanjong pagar for instance
and then at outram park you get off you don't get off the station you just walk up or down another level
walk down most probably
and then you uh switch to the purple line
okay
the line that connects to the to from the green to the to chinatown is that another transportation or is that something i have to go by foot
no it's the same uh system
it's just another name it's uh developed
the green line was developed first the green and the red line and this is an additional line that goes straight up northeast
so it makes it convenient
an so you stay within the station
you're just going to another level and there will be many signs marked out
there'll also be people there willing to help you
you can ask anybody around you
they'll be able to point you the way
okay
uh do they speak as good as you
oh they speak uh depends on who speak you to
um if they cannot understand you they will give you a look a blank look
and it could be a student from somewhere else or you know
uh someone whose not comfortable with english
but i think by the third time you ask someone should be able to ask uh answer you
right
okay
cause uh are you familiar with the reality show um amazing race
yes amazing race
uh but uh i don't is it on this weekend
do you know
because i don't know the programme
alright
but have you seen uh how they actually go about the competition
the game
yes yes
i've seen it on tv
but uh they had a singapore sector
but i miss that
yah they did
but um uh you know um i'm not very good when it comes to location or direction
so uh i'm not gonn i'm probably not gonna be a good fit for that game
that's what i'm saying
you need give me really good directions here
otherwise i get lost
oh no uh i am horrible with directions and i don't have a problem
you just uh make sure that you are heading northeast
so outside the train line there are signs to tell you which direction
you take the direction that goes towards punggol
can you see number seven on the top right inside
because you are going northeast
and then when you're going to sentosa you'll take the direction that says harbourfront
okay
yes
okay
uh anyway when you buy your ticket you should be able to get a map from the airport
uh and if you need help from the officer he will tell you
anyway since you mentioned it
at uh the right-hand side of the map uh can you see the green line
yes
at tanah merah you need to get off and switch to go to town
so this is where you go westwards
yes
so you just stand on the correct side of the station
um and uh if you are not sure just ask anybody
any of them who use that stop they are the people who work at the airport and they will be able to advice you
okay
okay
about the map that you mentioned is that something that i have to pay for or is it part of the trip
no it's uh usually given free
and i think they have a large stock of it at the airport
excellent
okay um so we now have options
um can you tell me more about the hotels that i have lined up for me
uh you mentioned little india farrer park
s so you want hotels in uh chinatown right
the cheap ones at least so i can enjoy the rest of my allocated budget
yes
okay i'll get you the hotels in chinatown first in singapore and then if you see what sort of culture uh would you prefer around where you stay
is it chinese culture or indian culture
hm um i would prefer chinese cause um i'm part chinese too
ah okay
but i like uh the environment when people still have uh still can get aloud even if you know late in the evening
you know um cause that's how we are me and my fiancée we usually go out late at night just to um grab a couple of drinks and uh just dance to the music and stuff like that
okay so chinatown is the best location because it's near the singapore river where you can have althe al fresco dining if you don't want to eat outside your hotel
and you can see we have a list of hotels here that are not very expensive
but uh decent hotels also
okay
so there is one good one here
just a minute
we're trying to catch it
no problem
okay
oh
uh let me get the ones in chinatown
so can you see a list of the prices there
yah i can
uh if you want a quaint hotel uh with nice design hotel nineteen twenty-nine
the building dates from nineteen twenty-nine and it's in a quiet -er part of the chinatown
but it's been completely refurbished
all these hotels are there's nothing murky or dirty about it because it's a conservation area
wow
since you mentioned it's 1929 uh aren't there any apparitions in there
like ghosts or something
uh i'm not sure
if they did would probably uh sell a ghost tour there
no not that i know of
okay
cause that's one thing i would definitely like to try
uh the you want to stay in a ghost hotel
a haunted place yah
i just wanna to try it out
it's a strange thing
oh you are strange
okay uh later you can go and do shopping uh at the street where people used to wait to die
uh it's called sago lane at the other end of chinatown
but it's about ten minutes away
okay
uh the other hotel if you want to save money can you see the top hotel
here
yes
keong saik
keong saik yes
that's on the same street and uh i must tell you that this used to be a red-light district in my grandfather's time
but it's all been cleaned up and uh if you don't want to have too much
uh to many people around your hotel this is the quieter side of chinatown
so you want me to show you this hotel
yah sure of course
okay
a picture would be nice
so you've been in this hotel obviously right
i've been in this area i've been in nineteen twenty-nine which invited travel agents and people in the tour business to visit
but i haven't been in this other one
but i think it looks okay
from the outside of view um actually um gotten feedback from people who actually go inside
uh no i haven't
uh but uh you can see if there are any uh ratings on the hotel
um hm yah
that would be very helpful
um one more thing is um this area you mentioned that keong saik and um nineteen twenty-nine is on the or are they are on the same street right
uh huh
yes on the same street
yes
so um is this part of chinatown's safe
yes it's very safe
uh it's very safe
uh you can walk out til midnight you know
you can find places to have uh supper
the shops around there might close around ten o'clock
but if you want to have a drink i would prefer you go down to the singapore river where the ambiance is uh by the singapore river
okay
if you look at this uh picture of the hotel can you see the building up there
okay
yes i can
and can you see additional remarks and notes
it won an architecture award in nineteen ninety-eight
which means it was restored just about completely restored about four years ago
and so it's quite new
hm okay
i don't know ghosts uh previous occupants
yah um it will be nice if i could experience that there
but i don't mind i don't mind if it doesn't
so um i'm considering either this one or nineteen twenty-nine
um based on your stay in nineteen twenty-nine and um the just the look of this hotel from the outside which do you think is um aesthetically better
you know better looking
you may
o uh nineteen twenty-nine has a very good reputation because the developer is uh you know he develops small hotels
so let me try and find you nineteen twenty-nine
okay
hotel nineteen twenty-nine oh sorry
so um
this hotel i actually went inside
um hm
when did you last stay here
you mentio
i didn't stay here
i just visited it when they had built it and they invited us from the travel industry to go in
uh what is interesting i don't know if this will uh excite you is that they have a room the best room is in fact uh at the rooftop
these are low-rise buildings
about 3 stories
but you see the rating here
is four stars
oh okay
right
not bad
pretty good huh
and if you'd yah huh
if you take that room you can have a shower in the open uh with just you know like palm trees and plants uh just all around you
uh the hotel owner and the staff tell us they have done a check and nobody from the nearby skyscraper uh business buildings can actually see you
i'm not so sure about that
i wouldn't risk it
you don't want to risk it
i thought you'd not scared of ghosts
you would not be afraid of this
well ghosts are different
uh i don't wanna expose my body to the other people
you are actually surrounded
it's just the top you know what i mean
it's just the roof it's not there
right
but uh how isn't it windy there you know
um it might actually affect the scene
okay then
then uh you can just take the suites
can you see the rooms there
yes they are nice
uh the one i'm talking about is the terrace suite
you can
terrace suite
oh
but
you can take a
does that one
a junior
um hm sorry
jeanne does that one the terrace suite also have um its own toilet and bathroom inside the room
not necessarily outside but inside
yup
i am not sure about that
uh i think they'd purposely put the the bathroom outside
ah they did
that's supposed to be part of the thrill of staying in that room
oh
i find the room really nice um honestly
but i don't like the fact that uh it's outside
the bathroom is outside
okay
okay
shall i show you the junior suite
yah
um i think the deluxe room is better cause the junior suite has uh two beds
first yes the okay
yes the deluxe is a double bed
yah this one
this one is better
it's very pretty isn't it
and you see you have your own wash basin here
it's like you know you are in your house
um hm okay
so the fittings and everything are it's listed under budget but it's not really budget
i wouldn't call it uh budget
uh when they've opened it was fully booked for many months
hm it's a very popular on the internet
okay
alright
so i think i'm gonna pick this one
this is uh seems like a sensible choice
so your location would be chinatown
so this is um nineteen twenty-nine
hotel nineteen twenty-nine
yes
that's right
so we gonna get you the rates now
and i'm going to get the deluxe suite
okay
can you get it on the screen now
yap i can see it
so this is double right
and this is uh for the entire year right
yes
so it's two hundred and ninety dollars
okay
that's fine
they have they have not mentioned any surcharge for easter weekend
so it should be alri wait
let's have a look here
peak period surcharge will be applied uh must be done in seven days cancellation seven days prior to check-in
so there might be a small surcharge because it's the easter weekend
right
um so i'm expecting some activities right
um activities at the museum
a lot of free activities you can enjoy uh but um we for here for singapore easter is mainly a religious festival and a public holiday
okay
so it's very solemn
uh yes it's solemn
but you can visit for example uh are you catholic
yes i am
so you can visit the catholic churches uh for mass
yah that would be nice
um which is the closest one or probably the nicest um church in this area here
there are several churches in singapore
um from where you are there are several catholic churches
okay
and the ones that many people go to is the cathedral of the good shepherd
okay
and since you are there you can also walk around and visit other churches uh within the area
alright
so let me get it for you
so we're going to fly over there uh on thursday
um will there be any churches open uh until friday
the churches will be open
um if the church is shut because there is no service uh you just go to the back you know where the priest lives and if you tell them you are tourist they might even bring you on a tour around the place
okay
oh that'll be great
are there
are they always accommodating
yes
uh at the cathedral here we even have lunch time masses for people who go for daily mass during the lunch hour
so this is a national monument and it is ones just a few stops from uh your hotel
from chinatown
okay
um cathedral of good shepherd
yes
how long has it been um up
uh can you see here eighteen thirty-two
but of course it has been uh repaired and uh upgraded many times
uh many of the foreign community in singapore
uh they come here because of its good location
and you can see we even have a korean chaplin
and we have many filipinas who help with the choir or you know with um collecting donations for the poor
uh you see on the fourth sunday we have a tagalog mass
okay
interesting
okay
so um that seems like a very good um time to go to church
but that's a sunday however
um we're only going to stay there til friday
yes
uh for easter fo uh you are staying for good friday are you
yah
is it good friday
that's right
yah you can visit the churches in the daytime
it's not a problem
okay
and in this vicinity we also have other churches
let me try and get for you
there's the saint joseph's church
okay
uh i hope you don't mind jeanne but uh are you also catholic
yes i am catholic
okay
actually i was going to introduce you to my church uh because i have a filipino choir
but they sing on saturday
so you won't get to see them
okay
saint joseph's church let me see huh
you are also into singing then
yes uh but i just you know back them up
the filipinos do all the major singing
all the solos
many of our choirs we have a large proportion of the filipino community in singapore that support the choirs
alright
yah
a lot of filipinos are very um they are so into singing
so every opportunity they get they sing
yes
yes okay
can you see this one
yes it's nice
this is very pretty and it's within walking distance of the cathedral
okay
uh and here we've got many statues inside and the way of the cross uh along the walls
uh this church served to the eurasian community
this is nicer
and yes this is prettier uh and it's an earlier church
it was set-up by the portuguese mission that came but uh after that the french mission took over uh building of the churches
so this is saint joseph
yes
and uh there's another one called saints peter and paul which is three minutes away from there
all of these are national monuments
they are protected
so they will be here even if you come back fifty years later
wow i definitely would try that
okay let me see
oh i should put in singapore
let me see whether i get saints peter and paul in singapore
so how do you feel about people would like to visit churches and then go drinking the night after
oh it's not a problem
the filipino choir do it all the time
yah
uh we often have get togethers and uh somebody will donate some drinks for the party
because uh we take public transport so they don't have to worry about uh you know driving after drinking
okay
so these churches i'm showing you they are within walking distance
all three of them
oh this is also nice
yes very pretty
very pretty
what is it called again
church of
saint saints peter and paul
saint peter and paul hm interesting
so do they have a museum or some sort
seems like a big place
um within this area we actually have the national museum
okay
good
okay
cause that will be nice if um after we actually look around or like uh go to church we'd also want to see um a little bit more
so museums would be nice
okay
uh national museum you may even get free entry because it's a if it's a public holiday
if it's good friday you are here uh you se you will you be here on good friday
yes we will be there
the public holiday
okay
this is about ten minutes from uh the churches
okay
ten minutes walking
by walking
walki yes
okay
so the location of where the churches are and where the museum is it's a old historic area
uh you just cross a few streets
can you see victoria street
yes
yes
so the churches are victo just pass victoria around victoria street queen street
you just cross these little roads and across the road
is the national museum
hm i see it
okay
so it's very convenient for you
right
um you mention that um this would probably be i'm looking at the same timeline
uh we probably would go to the church in the morning we probably stay there until noon
so noon where do we have where we could have lunch
a really nice place for lunch
uh if there are lots of places you can eat around there
um you could go to raffles what's the food are you looking for
oh good question
um let me see
uh i'm actually very conservative
um i don't really like a lot of junk food but if i don't have any other choice i take any of the fast food chains
but um i don't mind trying new things
so
so uh if you want to try new things without spending a lot of money there is a food court just near to where the churches are
and it's along bras basah road
uh i cannot quite remember the name
uh the food court
let me see if it's called the republic foodcourt
it's a chain be these food courts they are chains
just give us a moment
yah
hm no problem
go ahead
take your time
okay let me see
no the it is not uh republic
it's probably another one
okay
i'm gonna try uh this other name
it's in the same area right
yes it's in the same area
and what kind of food do they offer there
uh there you get a variety and you can see uh whether the food is suitable to you
okay can you see this
yes i can
okay the first one item on the list
is that pronounced as kofu
yah koufu
it's a chinese word
yah
it's a chinese term
kofu
okay do you know what
and
do you know what it means kofu
something to do with the mouth
okay
kou uh is a mouth
okay
uh at the fu if it's the correct fu is means the good luck of the mouth
that means you are eating good food or delicious food at good prices
i'm just interpreting it
i they have a story about it but i don't remember exactly
okay
okay
i believe you don't worry
okay
so there you have it the explanation
so you can tell if i'm telling a lie
uh yah good fortune
cause i remember is it really good fortune
feast on good food
yes
good fortune to feast on good food
alright
so on the left what you are seeing is what we have for breakfast a bun two eggs coffee or tea
and then you can have uh you know dimsum
yes i do
i love it
yah dimsum is to touch the heart and you can try there is a stall that sells uh variety of food
but at the food court it's interesting this one you know where the cathedral is that i recommended that you visit
uh is just opposite the cathedral
oh good
uh we have a university it's called the smu and this is this branch is at the basement of the smu
oh cool
is
so you don't have to be a university student to eat there
i often eat there because the prices are reasonable and we even have the vietnamese stall we have an indian stall uh and we have a lots of chinese food
okay
there you go
uh i'm definitely gonna try chinese
but um i've tried a few indian food as well but um what's the other
chi
vietnamese
vietnamese
i'm not sure if i tried that one but uh i definitely will
they uh the vietnamese do a very good rice roll spring roll
um okay
you know if you are into healthy foods spring roll that is not fried but they use a special rice roll
the roll the wrapper is made of rice
and so they have a lot of greens inside that it's very healthy
is it something like a maki
uh no it's not
it's like a spring roll except it doesn't have a crispy exterior
okay
you know we believe that if you all eat all this fried foods you get a sore throat
yah
so when you think you are feeling uh too much of the sun and you might get a sore throat then you go for this kind of food
okay
it's easier on the throat
right
oh you mentioned earlier that the price is uh reasonable
um i actually don't mind spending on food
if anything uh in this trip i don't mind spending on food
so uh that's something i'm definitely gonna try and consider
hm yes
there are if you go to this food courts you can try a whole variety of food without spending a lot of money
alright
so this place is good for um let say lunch
is it also good for dinner or um dessert
lunch
uh better for lunch
lunch there will be more stalls open
uh dinner time i suggest you go a bit earlier because some stalls may close in the evening
because the students would be there during the day time
there is another food outlet that is uh opposite this a little bit further down the road towards the museum but uh opposite where this outlet is
and that would be open late
okay
uh if you see can you see bras basah here on the little map
yes
so it's along the same road is just stretching down a little bit
uh and okay
yah that's the same place right
bras basah
yes it's the same location
alright
so i see it
so and so you could have your lunch at the smu
i call it smu foodcourt because i identify it with the university
okay
uh can you see bras basah road
yes
uh where the number a can you see the a there
yah the letter a
yah you can see the koufu foodcourt
if you go for the up the road towards prinsep street
uh but on the opposite side of bras basah road there is another food court there
i can't remember the name but it's one of a chain in singapore and you also get variety of food there
okay
so if you do the museum and then you want to have dinner nearby conveniently that's the place to go
awesome
alright
now um i think i already have my idea of places for when we get there which hotel we're gonna go where which church we're gonna visit have lunch and then go to the museum
um i'm assuming this would probably end at around six or seven in the evening
um wou which places would be um a nice place to go to if we are looking to have um a few drinks and um a really nice place
you know with um music and a little bit of scenery
you know views
yes
o okay
uh quite near to here and you can walk if you like or if you are too tired uh you can take may be two bus stops away is the singapore river
so i'm gonna suggest you go and walk along the river bank
you can have al fresco dining
so i'm trying to get it on the uh screen for you
okay
what do you call that
al fresco dining
uh that means you are sitting outside the restaurant
uh if it's too hot you can move-in
they usually have seating inside and outside
this is going to be uh early evening right
is it still hot at that time
yes
uh the sun is going down
so it's quite scenic
uh it depends on the day
if it's been a hot day you will get uh you might find it a bit warm
and then later in the evening you might find its nice
maybe at nine o'clock or ten o'clock
okay
okay
how about the music in this place
um is it up-to-date with you know the current hits
hum
i am not so up-to-date with music
but you can move along the various bars
uh some of them are sports bars that might interest you
they have a big tv screen
and if there is a match like a football match going on overseas people sit there and have drinks and watch the match
oh good
okay
uh you can start at boat quay and walk down towards clarke quay or you can visit the merlion by the singapore river
okay so
is that also another restaurant
no the merlion is the emblem of singapore's uh tourism
uh the former emblem of the singapore tourism board
it's half lion head and half uh fish
because we were a fishing village
and a prince came along and thought he saw a lion
so he asked actually he asked what it was and he was told it's a lion
can you see it now
uh it
okay
okay
this is
yah
this is different from the sentosa lion right
uh sentosa has a huge merlion about twelve stories high
this is not so tall but it's a favourite place for you to take photographs
it's uh most tourists on their first visit would go there and uh photograph it
can you see it
it's on the screen now
yes
so while you at facing boat quay if you walk left you get to the merlion
and so i think if it's early enough you might to want to take a photograph of the merlion first and then have your dinner along boat quay or clarke quay
yah
alright
and
these were good ones
okay
so definitely going to the merlion part
yes so it's just one bus ride from you know the bras basah road i showed you just now where the food courts are
yah
you take bus number one-three-one and you will reach there about fifteen or ten minutes
um how much do we have to pay for the transportation for the bus
uh the bus fare would be under a dollar for the two stops
but remember i said to buy a ezlink card
yah
right
so you top it up maybe you put in more money and then you'll get uh bigger refunds
so you don't have to worry about topping up the value
okay
so short stops is under a dollar
uh longer stops may be up to a little over two dollars
what do you think
if you travel by train it's a bit more expensive
what do you think is a reasonable amount i need to put in the ez uh card
ezlink card
uh do you want to visit the zoo and the night safari
oh yah
i think that those would be good options too
okay i think you put in uh maybe put aside another twenty dollars to top it up
it's twelve dollars to buy the card
okay
so twelve dollars to buy the card and ten more dollars for additional transportation expenses
okay
hm no twenty dollars so about thirty
twenty dollars alright
so that's thirty-five dollars let's say give or take right
but that's more than enough
you uh
it's just so you don't have to worry about
you know um uh topping it up
uh if you go to a seven eleven store which is open round the clock you would be able to top-up your card
but if you put more you save time
yah
right
okay
yah i think i'm gonna do that first
i don't wanna be hassled by uh having to go to um another place
but um yah i'll store everything i need at least the maximum amount in the stored value uh ezlink card so i can just go around
yes that's ri
okay
uh then you can go the
do you want to go to the zoo and the night safari
yah that will be nice
okay
i'll give you the website of wildlife reserves
and i can show you pictures of three uh parks that is run by this uh company
and i suggest you buy a package ticket so it is uh cheaper for you for the entrance fees
when you say package how many people are supposed to be in there
oh no the package is per person
but you can either choose to visit two parks or three parks
okay
okay
but whatever you choose if you buy separately say you entered the zoo and then next day you enter the bird park and you're buying individual tickets you are paying more
so if you decide where you want to go and then you uh buy the ticket on your first visit then you hold on to the ticket and on the next at the next park you just present the same ticket
great
i'm trying to organise my itinerary or uh our itinerary here
so um is it possible for me to actually pay for these in advance so that when we actually get to the hotel we would know um what we need to do next where were gonna stay at this time of the day and then uh when we can actually visit to wildlife reserve
you know is it something that's possible
uh wildlife reserves i am not sure
normally the tickets are sold at the door
but if you want to pay for your hotel in advance i'm very sure they're very happy to take your money
you can give them your credit card number and they will send you an e-mail confirmation
so you at least for the hotel booking uh which i think is very wise of you to book in advance
yah
um hm yah
but the wildlife reserves the parks um this have to be done over the counter
yes
unless you buy from a travel age and then
hello
you buying a whole
hello
yes
you still there
yes i'm here
i'm trying to get the pictures for you
okay
alright
so see
we have a successful hornbill nesting uh in the park
and in fact we are releasing some of the hornbills into singapore
wow
oh
that's nice
here you see the uh
aviary
aviary
and this is king of the skies show
uh here you can volunteer to take part in the show without paying extra
like how take part
uh take part in the actual um show
like um act it out or something
uh i shouldn't tell you i take away the fun
ah okay
alright
king of the skies they ask you to participate
and uh you just put up your hand and if they select you then you go up there
so there will be many people putting up their hands
uh so you may or may not be selected
okay cause i'm not gonna get scared am i
uh not you i think
uh sometimes they don't take very young children
so the uh trainers know what to do
alright
you can also uh when you arrive get the uh feeding time schedule
and if you plan your visit to particular aviaries during feeding times you can watch them being fed
oh okay
so in the african uh aviary that you saw a minute ago you can hold the bird seeds actually they are worms
you hold them in your hand and the birds will come and take the worms off your hands
okay
uh i was actually worried that i might have to put the worms inside my mouth and they eat it from my mouth
no then the birds will eat up your tongue
yah
i was of scared of that
uh but i've seen it on tv before
oh no uh i think not in singapore
no
let me try and get you uh okay the zoo
okay
in the zoo you have a variety of animals too
yes and it's an open zoo uh next to a reservoir
so it's very scenic
i think uh you would love it for its photography
wow
uh the only new things you see is this
what is that
what is that
it's it's a naked mole rat
oh okay
so it doesn't have any hair
i know
it's cute
nudist colony
bu i know you're expecting something else
okay
uh look
can you see the great rift valley of ethiopia
can you see that on your screen
hello
yes i can
so you see this uh creatures here
we got them from ethiopia and we have set-up an environment like they would live-in africa
they are baboons
yah
yah baboons
um by the way um since you're showing me all of this it reminds me of something
do you actually have um baboons running around excuse me
the place um the area
um the city i mean. um
oh no uh the only baboons are the human ones
do you have any of that
oh no
uh these baboons
that's not very nice
the uh these baboons are they have been replica there have been very successful breeding there so so it's a very large population
and you are likely to see maybe a mother feeding a young
uh it's the enclosure is glass
so you're fully protected
okay
okay that's good
cause uh i heard from my friends who actually visited india that they see a lot of um monkeys or baboons running around uh where they're staying you know
and it's a city
yes
so
oh yah
it can be scary
we have monkeys not baboons
uh monkeys that uh that in the you know in the forest areas
so we tell people not to feed them because we feed them then they expect food
right
uh you can eat with the orang-utans though
can you see the middle one
the jungle breakfast with wildlife
yah
uh you actually eat your own breakfast
and the orang-utans at the back the ones in brown they have a sort of open area where they can swing around and play in the trees
but during breakfast time they come down and they have a buffet of fruits to eat
and then after that you would be invited to take photographs with them
hm if it is safe enough to actually eat in their presence or do they try to steal your food
no they don't like our kind of junk food
they have better food
okay
they have fruits
they are more health conscious
they are huh
okay
okay
and what s what's the last one
okay the last one is the uh river saf uh sorry
the night safari
there's also a river safari you can take inside the zoo which is new
but you might be running out of time
so let me show you the night safari
uh i'm not sure if this is one but you know the giraffes that you see here
just had a baby giraffe born
so it very interesting to see
so we'll be able to catch this ju new baby giraffe right
i can't promise that
um the you will have to see the situation uh when you get there because they take care of the young uh likely you can see because it will be with the mother if they do not put it aside uh some place
uh you take a tram that looks a tiger at the back
and you can see the you can see these creatures in black and white
okay
they are uh malayan tapirs
and they quite tame so they roam around uh the path of the trams
they try and give way but sometimes they forget the traffic rules
alright
but um you mentioned they're tame right
yes they are very tame
but you know they won't listen to you if you tell them to get out of the way
so if you're on the tram ride and they are there uh it's nicer
because when you wait then you have a chance to see better
yah uh you're right
you're probably right
but um this is done in at night
so um are we actually gonna be given um night vision goggles or something
or do we is the place well lit
at night
uh you can get in earlier to have your dinner
so i'm suggesting you go to the zoo in the afternoon
okay
and walk across their carpark to the night safari
have a meal before the actual entrance to the park opens at seven thirty
because that's when we get night time
uh the keepers will put food near to where the lights are
and that would be in an area where as you are on the tram you can get a very good view of them
okay
so you will be able to see them
so you cannot use your camera
uh firstly it disturbs the animals and then second you also disturb the other people on the tram ride
so they don't allow photography uh
oh good thing you mention
i was actually thinking of bringing my camera
you can bring your camera because in the outside area where there are no animals many people take photographs
right
but uh in the areas where there are animals we're not allowed to right
no you can't because you spook the animals
right
that's right
okay good
good tip
and uh you can see this show the creatures of the night show
what is that thing hanging
it's re yes
uh it's somebody who's walking on a rope just above your heads
so uh again i'm not gonna tell you
you have to visit the zoo
okay
uh actually i forget
i forget what it is
uh but you know when you go there if you don't want you're not comfortable with the animals right above your head you just avoid the overhanging uh rope and you just go little bit further back and you can see it as it goes along
okay
interesting
okay
so it seems i have everything from this first day of our stay in singapore
how about the second day i think i'd still have a few hours
uh before our trip back to manila
okay wait
le uh are you interested in the ticketing prices for this
um yes definitely
first
okay
i'd like to know that
okay
there you seeing some of the animals
this is in the night safari
these are beautiful they are anteaters
and antelopes
um okay so are we looking at the prices
yes i'm trying to get the prices for you
wait just a minute
i thought you're showing me more animals
yah
okay sorry
here it is
there you go
uh so if you're visiting all three you pay only fifty-eight dollars per person
okay
that seems reasonable
you see up here
if you're visiting only the night safari it's thirty-two dollars
yah i think i'm gonna go for the three-in-one
yes that's right
so
so there are two of us so that uh it counts to hundred and sixteen dollars
yes
yap that still within um our funds
so yah i'm good with this
a hundred sixteen actually right
it's fifty-eight per person
yah hundred sixteen dollars for both of us uh for this trip
yes that's right hm
and that doesn't include the meal right
cause um you mentioned that or you suggested that we go through uh dinner first and then go back for the night safari
yah
e uh if you're at the zoo you can eat at the zoo
there are places to eat
uh or you can walk over to the night safari and you can either have a regular chinese meal or a buffet or you can have sandwiches uh burgers
they have something called the bongo burger which is the name of an animal
but there's no bongo meat in it
you just get a chicken or i think may be uh fish
i'm not sure if it's available
but it's just normal meat
so don't worry about eating wild animals there
okay
alright
i'm not really worried
um i'm just conservative when it comes to um eating junk food versus eating healthy food
so i prefer you know variety of healthy stuff
but yah i think i have everything i need
thank you very much jeanne
you've been very helpful
hm it is okay you're most welcome
i hope to see you in singapore dodie
yes definitely
i'm definitely um try to see you there
well thank you very much
i had a great time
thank you for helping me
thank you
nice talking to you
bye
alright
bye
bye
hello
hello
hi
good afternoon
hi i'm good afternoon
i'm jeanne and i am guide number two
who is calling please
hi jeanne my name is june
um and i'm parti
june
yap
and i'm participant number thirty-three
three three yes
yes that's correct
okay
how can i help you june
hi jeanne
um i will be s uh i just got married last uh month
and uh my husband and i is planning for an asian tour for our honeymoon
um now uh it just so happen that we're just we're kind of thinking of staying to singapore um for at least two nights
would you be able to help me with that
yes
uh what sort of uh hotel are you looking at
um you mean um hotel categories
yes that's right. uh
what
well we're a kind we're actually working on a budget. um
uh i'm not really sure and familiar with your hotel categories that you have there in singapore
it will be our first time
but if you could work on the budget that we have that would be great
and that is
what is your budget
yep
um we're working on one thousand singaporean dollars
one thousand dollars for the both of you
for the both of us
that should include our meals our trips and everything
okay
um so maybe i gave you a hotel that's not so expensive
would you like to go to hotel in chinatown
uh it's a boutique hotel in a conservation shophouse
so it's not like a big fat grand hotel that we get in town you know
uh this is more personal
i see jeanne
now my concern is how far would that be from the airport
uh not very far
shall i show you the airport map first then
sure
okay
so um shall there'll be um a person or a ride that could pick us up uh from the hotel uh from the airport going to the hotel
or um where will we take a subway
it's easier
uh actually it's a you save money and you save time in the sense that you don't have to wait for people to pick you out
it's more exciting also because you see the locals
ah okay you what are you seeing is a portion of the mass rapid transit
okay
can you see the map with the four colours
yes
so where you get this little round dots that joint up are the intersections of the different lines
i'm
when you come in you are at number three on the right-hand side of your screen
okay
and that is the east-west line
okay
uh chinatown is on the purple line
can you see it
purple line
ah okay
yes uh where you see number six and go you up to outram park and then you go down to chinatown one more stop and that is chinatown
so if you take uh the subway to town
and it's not all the way subterranean
it is above ground so you get a bit of sightseeing right up until kallang which can you see it on the map
on the green line
yes i'm seeing it right now
there's a so after you pass there uh you would go from kallang down towards the purple line
you see outram park
and then you go out up one stop to chinatown
so there will be um at least two drop-offs for me from the airport
you mean to say that um i need to take the east-west line until the kallang and then drop-off there and ride another railway
no uh i'm just saying that up to kallang you can see it's up above ground
a few metres
you can see the area
and then the ground it goes underground uh and so chinatown area is busy
so all that is underground and also up to chinatown
so when you switch you just get off your train
there will be announcements to tell you are coming to an interchange
you um follow the directional signs whether you're going up the stairs or down the stairs you just switch and most likely you go further deeper into the ground
so you have to take the escalator down
and then you take it to chinatown
ah okay
okay
okay
so um now that i'm seeing the map
um where is the city centre
okay
uh chinatown is where we have a large congregation of chinese but we also have one of the oldest hindu temples in chinatown and uh also have mosque and churches there
there's a methodist church in that area
further along the line is little india which is two stops three stops up north
and uh there you can uh soak in the indian atmosphere
ah okay
and okay to show you the relation to the rest of the town
okay wait
if you take the purple line down south can you see number six on the map
bottom left-hand side
yes
yap
that's harbourfront and that faces sentosa island uh where we had
oh okay
what's sentosa island
is that like a real island
beaches
yes it's a real island
a beach
it's an island with beaches but there there's also a road link that you can go over
so uh after i settle your hotel you just tell me what you are interested in
yap
i just want to know um where in this map would you find the merlion
okay the merlion is okay on the same map can you see uh can you see clarke quay
yes
that's the stop from which you can walk towards the merlion
oh that's nice
okay
so i think um being in chinatown would be a perfect choice then
okay
chinatown alright
and if you since we're on the map okay
later you tell me what are the other attractions that you like to visit what is the
well um merlion is the only one that uh we know about singapore
um my husband would love to um play golf
do you golf courses available nearby
uh we have golf courses on sentosa island
but uh let me first uh show you the merlion that you are talking about
so the mrt map the map for the trains don't show you the location of our rivers
uh but here where you see the blue on the map that is formerly just the entrance to the river
it is now closed in and it's a reservoir
the merlion is do you see a little i there
can you see
yes
uh so that's the location of merlion park and that's where the merlion is
is the half fish and half lion uh first emblem of the singapore tourism board right
okay
is that um is going to that park for free
and yo yes it's for free all the time
day and night
nice
okay
that sounds good
um now cause i've
as i've mentioned we're only gonna be there for two nights
so that's basically we're arriving um around six p.m. and then uh we're gonna be staying the day after then we're gonna have an overnight and we're leaving at the following day
so we'll basically have a very short stay in singapore
so um if you could suggest some activities that we could do
so as i have mentioned that my husband would love to be to have a little tee-off time during the morning and then um in the middle of perhaps in the middle of the day if we could have um you know uh sightseeing
and then of course at night uh perhaps i'd go shopping and uh try out some um very good restaurants around
uh huh
okay
let me try and get you uh places where you can golf in singapore first
okay
yap
uh so how much would the hotel be again
oh hotel is a little over a hundred dollars i think
just a minute uh
hm okay
okay maybe this one is very accessible
this is also on the bay
okay
on the bay
so will that be near the merlion
yes near the merlion
but uh you may have to take a taxi there because uh it is along the highway
how much would the taxi fare be from our hotel
from your hotel it depends if you're going during peak hours in the morning there's a surcharge
but it should not be more than ten dollars
oh okay
so it's a very nice area because it's right next to the bay and so you can see the sea uh right there
um could you show me how much that would be
okay i'm trying to find it here
okay
so how is your day going so far jeanne
it's fine
it's a fine day in singapore
no rain
oh
yah
it's a bit shady here
uh got cloudy skies and um rain is pouring a little bit
but pretty good
yes we have also uh a bit of hazy skies uh overcast
hm okay
i'm trying to find the price of this for you
okay that's fine
uh just a minute
how long have you been um a tourist guide uh jeanne
a little more than twenty years
wow that's nice
uh let me see huh
a lot of changes in singapore a lot of new things
oh that's nice to hear
so you can come back every year and you will get new attractions to see
okay
just a moment
sure that's fine
okay these are the rates
uh is it a weekend or weekday
did i ask you you said june right
you haven't quite fixed the days
um well actually we're spending um an asian tour
so perhaps we're eyeing around um the ninth of april
so oh
uh sorry
june is your name
i'm sorry
ninth of april up til
yes
so we'll be arriving at the ninth tenth o oh until the eleventh
so we're checking out on the eleventh
yes
eleventh
eleventh yes
uh can you tell me off-hand is the ninth a weekend or a weekday
i believe that's a monday
so the ninth yes it's a monday
and you're checking out
so good
so it's a non-weekend uh timing so you are more likely to get
uh to book your uh golf session because it's would be a day where people work
hm okay
so how much would that be
so i'm seeing there weekdays for an eighteen hole is seventy five dollars
uh that's for singaporeans and permanent residents
you would be in the category of hundred and fifteen dollars
okay
oh alright
cause you're a visitor
okay
okay so you do have foreign rates as well
yes we do for the golf courses
uh and i think there's some membership if they joined uh for singaporeans where they get some discount
ah i see
okay uh would you know we what time of the day we can start
okay
we had the timings earlier right
i'm not really sure
uh le
but definitely um we're hoping to take the golf um a little a golf the golf play around um six a.m. perhaps
six a.m.
would that be yap
uh i think it's still
would that be possible
i think it's still dark
you want the eighteen hole
yes
it okay eighteen hole you want to book the timing is that right
yes
what times can we um start with the game
six o'clock it is still dark in singapore
uh so i don't think you can uh book a course at that time
see it's seven o'clock
ah okay seven o'clock
but seven o'clock would be okay
it's not too bad at all
uh huh
yes it's good because at that time it is very cool still
yes
the sun will come out uh about nine and by ten it gets a bit warm
oh there
so the following are the revised tee times for wednesday
but we're actually gonna have that on a tuesday
would you have a tuesday time
i thought these are normal times
uh what you see here
okay
so those are just normal times
this yes uh oh so do you need to see for wednesday
so for some reason on wednesdays they have a different timing
hm okay
okay
so you're gonna play golf on tuesday right
yes
okay what else would you like to know
um so uh how much would uh our can i have a look at um your hotel offers
okay you want to see the hotel
yes
okay
let me get your hotel for you
so you okay with chinatown
yes
i think that would be a good choice
um o is it safe there
it's very safe it's very convenient
your singapore is a singapore tourism board website that you can go to to help plan your tours
hm okay
so we're
just give us a
just a give us a while for it to come on screen
okay
uh what were you going to ask me
um i hope that the hotel is not that um not on the range of uh um like a motel
uh what do you mean uh like a motel
like um where in you have a very small room
uh the rooms are small in chinatown and in little india because they occupy what used to be shophouses
and uh hotels what they do is they uh the owners buy up several uh units of these of shophouses and convert them into hotels
i see
but let me show you a picture uh of the hotel
can you see here
yes i'm trying to look at your hotel
this uh up
do you want the picture of the whole hotel
um i just needed picture of perhaps um does that hotel have a dining area
you you want a dining area for the hotel
let me have a look
cause we might have um our dinner when we arrive
okay
well you don't need to worry about the dining area
this is the reception area
because in chinatown after you put down your bags you just walk out and there are lots of places to eat
yah but that would be um we're already tired by that time
so we'd rather stay at the hotel for dinner
anyways we'll have the whole day the ne the day after to roam around
okay let me see
it has got can you see the amenities
internet access air conditioning internet services lounges and bars
i'm gonna go to full list
so lounges so there is really no um restaurant in that hotel
not in the hotel but in the vicinity plenty of places to eat
uh why the restaurants don't uh why the hotels they don't provide food is because i think the guest prefer to just go out and try uh either street food or food from the cafés and restaurants nearby
ah okay
yah
you might be able to get the um concierge to buy something for you from somewhere nearby and just pay him for it
oh okay then
alright
so it's indicated there that there is internet services
uh will that be for free
yes internet services are all these services here are usually free
if they want you to pay they will tell you that you have to pay
oh okay
uh can i check on the um pictures of the room
okay the pictures of the room
this is the outside
why don't i go through the pictures shall i do that
okay
cause i can't quite make out from here uh what is being shown
okay
this is interior
this is just outside
this is the entrance
okay
oh so it is decorated in traditional style uh with uh with traditional porcelain ware and there on the side you have tourist brochures that you can pick-up
and those are for free
free yes
for free and they are very informative
you can uh if you get them the walk of chinatown you'll be able to uh follow it and do a walk
this is a traditional set of uh tables that we used to have in our kitchen
so you can have breakfast in your kitchen marble table and two chairs
so uh this is the dining area
actually i think you can get can you see this at the corner on the left-hand side
you should be able to get snacks like curry puffs cakes
okay
uh coffee and tea
as you go upstairs this is your room then
ah so you don't have elevators on that hotel
uh i don't think so because these are just three-story buildings
they're very small
uh they are very cosy because they are in restored buildings that are protected
okay
are you thinking of uh more modern type of hotel
hm maybe around two to three stars hotel or to three to four-star hotel would that how much would that cost in singapore
so so you want a two to three-star hotel
or three to four
three to four-star hotel
yah
not much of a budget cause as you know um this will be a honeymoon for us
so of course um staying at the hotel would also be part of our adventure
okay
shall we try this furama uh riverfront hotel
okay
it's by the river and uh it's a more modern style hotel with larger rooms
okay wow it is nice
yes uh it's your preference you know what i mean
this is
wow
okay
yah
this is larger
that's nice
so the reception areas are larger let me go through the uh it's going through automatically
that's the reception area
that looks better
okay i know you now that you like modern hotels huh
they have a good buffet spread
okay
if you have a good appetite
so we do ha uh that one hundred seven three singaporean dollars is inclusive of breakfast
uh i have to check that out
okay
let me see if it's inclusive of breakfast
yah
so do you ac
it doesn't yah
sorry
it doesn't say here
it doesn't state it
okay
so how do i booked that
i just go to that website
yes you go that website
uh it's by the river and it's not so near to chinatown then
you have to travel by bus into chinatown
but this is definitely a bigger hotel i think more to your taste
ah okay it's far from chinatown
so it would be wi no it's not far
it's about two three bus stops away
the chinatown area has another hotel in chinatown but it's not as pretty as this one from the outside
it's an older version of a hotel
well i've seen that um next to chinatown will be clarke quay
is that somewhere in north clarke quay
uh yes it is
you have to walk to clarke quay from here
but it's within walking distance
ah okay
walking distance from clarke quay okay
yes walking distance to clarke quay
there is another hotel by the river if you want to be on the riverfront is called the gallery hotel
but let's have a look at this one
there's another furama you want to be in the middle of chinatown
i wanna be in the middle of the city
so that i can um be readily accessible to the attractions
this is also in the city
is just uh not as convenient as the previous hotel that i showed you
because the chinatown stop on the subways stops exactly there
uh here it is better if you are tired of walking you can take a bus to connect with the trains to reach your hotel
okay
so which stop from the railways which railway station shall i shop in order for me to get a bus
you just stop at the city centre and then you get out and you take one bus number one nine five and it will bring you to your hotel in about fifteen minutes or so
ten minutes actually
so if we have red lights along the way then its fifteen minutes
um what's the name of the um station at the city centre
the station is city hall
it's a major station and it's in a business district so you don't even need to take that train if you outside your hotel if you take the buses uh you can go to where city hall is and you can walk around the area
we have historic buildings there we have a big theatre and concert hall uh by the bay
okay
yah cause i'm thinking that if i'm gonna get this hotel
hello
oh what you se yes i'm here
yap
so i'm just thinking that if i'm gonna get that hotel
um coming from the airport of course um i'm gonna take the subway or the east-west line
uh which station should i drop off
oh you drop off at city hall station and you take bus number one nine five
hm okay
alright then
that that's not difficult because it will stop you right in front of your hotel
uh does this hotel have a golf course maybe
no we don't have the size
uh our golf courses are separates uh usually
oh it's separate
ah yes
okay
yah
that's nice
okay
okay i think that just uh that uh hotel is more likely that we're gonna take
um now once we get uh as you've mentioned do you have anything else that we after we take the golf course
so i have now listed in my plan to go to marina bay golf course
uh what other uh attractions could you suggest for sightseeing that is nearby from marina bay
so hm. oh uh would yah
so from marina bay if you uh come out and go to the uh city centre area that's where we have the esplanade theatres on the bay
it's uh a big theatre and concert hall
yah but that would be um too lengthy of a time to stay at the theatre
just of course we're gonna watch some things some shows and um i think we don't have much time to watch some shows
oh i'm not suggesting you watch shows
i'm just suggesting you have a look at the place uh and take photos uh because you are looking out at the marina bay sands hotel which is quite iconic and the uh bay right in front of the singapore river
so that's where many people like to take photographs
and if you want to have a meal you can have it uh inside
uh the shopping where the uh theatres are
can you see the pictures here now
ah okay
oh yah it looks like a durian
durian yes
that's what it's been called locally
but the architect meant it to look like the top of the microphones
you know the old type of microphone
ah oh yah
okay
so you know it as the durian also huh
no i just thought that it looks like a durian
yes it does look like a durian
uh so it's a nice place to take photographs to walk around uh because
okay so the i can actually go inside right
yes you can go inside
and uh we sometimes do have lunchtime concerts
uh but that would depend on um the esplanade's uh schedule
it's about only forty five minutes or one hour during lunchtime
it's to encourage locals to step into our concert hall
so that you know later on they would buy the concert tickets and attend that concerts
so i see
um jeanne um how long do you think uh would be enough for us to stay inside
uh well it depends on what you are interested in
uh lots of great shops here and uh chocolate shop
and places where you can have a drink or a meal
but if you don't do all that
you just take a look and then you walk along the outside
you can see by the ri uh by the theatre you can reach the marina bay
so maybe ten fifteen minutes inside and outside to photograph it
and then you walk to merlion
i think fifteen minutes with you stopping to take photographs
um hm fifteen minutes
so around perhaps we're alloca so we're gonna be finishing our tea golf around nine
so we're perhaps if it's very near marina bay uh going to the esplanade would take us around fifteen minutes
and then uh we're gonna spend at the esplanade around so that's nine fifteen
we're gonna be there until eleven perhaps
yes you take your photographs you walk slowly and have a look soak in the atmosphere
alright
or ten thirty and then uh we can walk going to merlion from here
yah
yes you can walk and uh i do that as well
because uh you know i don't even think you can take a bus there it's so near
right
okay so picture taki what else can we do at the merlion park
from the merlion park i suggest you get across to uh boat quay and clarke quay
what can we do there
uh see here you are at the bay in front of the river
uh later you uh walk along the singapore river itself
and if you are energetic you can walk all the way home to your hotel
well i can deal with that
i don't think my husband will be very happy about that
well he can play golf you know
he is a fit
so uh if you did it at seven in the morning it's very nice
i have done it once before
uh you come across some joggers some people walking their dogs
okay
um okay so we're gonna stop at merlion um at the merlion park do we have um restaurants available there
yes there are restaurants uh nearby at because there's a big hotel called the fullerton hotel and they own the place in front of the hotel by the river oh sorry by the bay
it's called one fullerton and there are lots of uh places you could have a meal
how much would the range of the meals be in that place
that place uh depends on what you order actually
uh if you go inside the hotel and you eat at the jade restaurant it would cost you a bit more
maybe uh sixty or seventy dollars a person
okay
if you walk along the singapore river
um there are places that serve lunch at prices that office workers can afford
because many office workers in the area behind can you see the river on the map
so on the south banks of the river where you see north canal road
behind that area is the business district
and some of them would actually eat uh along the singapore river
so you can get a meal there fifteen dollars twenty dollars per person
more than enough for the both of you
um i don't think that walking along would be a really um commendable for my husband
do you have um car rentals available
uh no i suggest you take a boat
would you like to take a boat home
you know
from the merlion you can board a boat
uh these are electric boats that ply the bay and the river and they also do like a taxi service alo with the stops along the river
and there is one stop
at the back of your hotel
hm that's nice
how much is the boat ride
oh um if you're taking the taxi ride it's under ten dollars
uh if you do a tour with them going around the bay then it's about fifteen dollars or so
hm okay
alright
so were gonna have lunch perhaps nearby the merlion
um do you suggest any ho um promising um restaurants nearby aside from the jade restaurant
uh just by the river there are restaurant
i forget the name um but it was a very good japanese restaurant if you like japanese food
uh we want authentic singaporean food
okay
singaporean food
hm let me see
at one fullerton
let me check out one fullerton uh where see if they have anything that what is what i would consider singapore food huh
the one fullerton areas for food
the hotel is the fullerton hotel
but one fullerton is the name of the area opposite where we have all the restaurants
so that is just across the hotel
yes of the okay
oops
i got the wrong spelling there
okay
singaporean food you do you like seafood
seafood yah
okay there's one right next to the merlion
and this is a website uh put up by a singaporean who checks out places to eat
palm beach
so so you can get crabs there you can get a uh you have you heard of chicken uh sorry uh chili crab
um perhaps
would you kne would you tell me something more about it
can you take hot food
yes
both of us love hot food
so chili hot huh
yah
okay
so chili crab is uh the big crab that is cooked in chili sauce and tomato sauce with onions and egg and a little bit of flour
so here you see some pictures of it
wow
if you're thinki
that looks delightful
yes it's very nice
it's finger licking good so you must use your hands to eat
ah okay
it's quite acceptable yes
that's nice
uh you can tell the waitress that you don't want to take too hot chili and then they will tone it down
but if you want more chili you can tell them also
okay
so right
so we have half of the day planned
um right after lunch that would be around two p.m. what would be a good thing to do
you can uh what other places what are your interest besides uh the golf
well for me i plan to shop
but um i don't think at two p.m. that would be a really nice um time to shop cause it might be too hot
oh if you do street shopping then it's a bit warm
but if you're going to the shopping malls uh let me try and get you do you want to go shopping along the more expensive areas or are you thinking of street shopping
um well street shopping would do i think
cause um i've heard that's really expensive when we go to shopping malls in singapore
uh shopping malls not really expensive uh in the sense that the shopping malls have a mix of expensive as well as not so expensive uh items
street shopping i think in chinatown you can do it in the evening
yah
uh it
but around two p.m. what do you think we do what do you suggest for us to do
let me tra
okay if you want to get away from the heat and near to your hotel you can visit a museum just across the road
oh nice
okay
okay
across the road of our hotel
yes the asian civilisations museum
do you have a singapore museum where we can actually um uh learn about singapore
yes
let me uh get you this museum first
if you talking about history is the singapore history museum
uh this one will give you uh only singapore the history around the river
that means the early history of singapore and what went on by the uh sorry
asian
i'm not sure
um i have seen this um documentary from um national geographic
um there is a museum where you have bottles of water on the wall because um they've said that um water was very um a very important resource way back then as it you actually import that
is that true
civilisation
yes we import water
so that museum is uh it's by the bay
it's called marina barrage
are you interested in that
yes i think i'd like to see that wall with a lot of mineral uh water bottles
uh it's just the empty water bottles huh
used for the decor it's called the marina barrage
and uh it will tell you about the bay that you're looking at right in front of you at the merlion
so can you see the pictures there
um but tiny
yes tiny
so here you go
so there is uh or i don't know whether you can call it a museum but when you enter it gives you the history of singapore in fact and the development along the rivers
uh all the rivers
our efforts like cleaning up all our rivers because now some of the rivers flow into this area that is called the marina bay
and that's how we are able to close it off
can you see it at this picture here
can you enlarge that for me
yah i'm trying to enlarge it
it's a little bit slow
is it free to enter that barrage
yes it's free
okay
okay
so it's designed a little bit like uh the number nine
hm what's the significance of number nine
well for well it's just the architect's design
but uh for a chi yah for chinese we do like number nine also
we have to wait a little bit uh for the picture to appear
oh well that's fine
that's fine
um so we're going to i think this would be a good time for us to check this out after lunch
yes
so perhaps around four o'clock
we can go straight to shopping
do you what's the shopping district called
we have many shopping districts
the one that's most famous is in downtown orchard road
and there you get many high-end brands
as well as uh medium priced
uh another place you might want to check out is opposite to sentosa island and it's called vivocity
it's very popular everyday uh especially in the evenings after work
can i get
vivocity and harbourfront
hm harbourfront
hm okay
um can i get um tokens like a souvenir items from those shops
uh you can get them there
but you might want to if you want to save money you go down to chinatown and you would be able to uh buy more things with your money
hm okay
that's nice
that's very cost effective
okay
so during the evening what do you suggest
um for us to take our dinner
i wanted something special this time
yah
uh you might want to have dinner um let me see huh
marina barrage
do you want to have dinner at uh the marina bay sands
uh it's an integrated resort with very high-end uh restaurants
how much would that would do you think would cost us to have dinner there
so uh maybe two three hundred dollars for the both of you
two to three hundred dollars for the both of us
yes
okay so i'm just trying to think
a hundred and seventy three so that would cost us around uh three hundred forty six and then we're gonna have three hundred
so that would mean we're only left with less than four hundred dollars to spend
so
yah that said so
but here you get sort of can you see fine dining and casual dining
so if you don't pick fine dining it wouldn't be so expensive then
um anything else that you think would not be too costy but still going to be very romantic for the both of us
let me think huh
let me find a a hotel maybe at the how much what is your budget
well as i've said um for the entire trip um we're only working on one thousand singaporean dollars
so that's for everything
so
so your budget for this good meal that doesn't cost too much
doesn't cost too much
but as i've said um i'm good with the hotel
so that's one hundred seventy three for per night
that if i'm going to ha stay for two nights that would mean three hundred forty six in total
so i'm left with like less than nine um six hundred dollars to spend for the whole day
so um a lot of places that you've mentioned um will be
uh huh
and your your golf is a hundred and fifteen so you have to take that off
yah
yap so i'm left with four hundred
so you have uh four hun five
four
four hundred
yah roughly four hundred dollars
double five five hundred and thirty five dollars and you don't want to spend it all on dinner
yes of course
ah okay
cause of course we're still going to shop
i'm going to shop
so perhaps shopping would be around two hundred
two hundred three
two hundred
so you can eat here
so two hundred if you take it out for shopping you still have three hundred over dollars for a fine meal
so you can even do fine dining here
yah but of course we still have to take um transportation and all this stuff
tips and anything
so you know we don't wanna be too tight
i see
yes
okay we got the menu for you here and should have a price there
can you read it
the price not really clear for me
you can't see the price
let me see
is that the one below each of the meal
like this mesclun salad is fourteen dollars
fo the yes that is right
ah okay
so you see if you don't order of full meal from salad soup main meal and then have a dessert and coffee it wouldn't cost you so much
it's if you go the all the full works with wine and everything then it would be more expensive
okay but this marina bay sands is really good
yes it's uh the chefs are well-known and the ambiance is good
i don't know what that hotel or what that place is but um i have seen pictures of a floating building
and it's
uh it's not really floating
it looks floating
it's a three towers uh on the opposite side of the bay
so from where you are looking at it sometimes it looks like it's floating
yes you are right
so what's that place
so that is the hotel and integrated resort
so we have a casino there actually
what hotel is that
that's the marina bay sands
but uh
oh so we're on that place
know it
yes that's right
ah okay
so are is that restaurant that one at the top
uh whether it's at the top of the hote it may not be right at the top because they have a swimming pool
it may be there i'm not very sure
wow it would be amusing to have dinner at that place
for that i can see the entire singapore i believe
yes bistro moderne i'm not sure
a few hotels are at the top but i cannot confirm with you whether this one is at the top
ah okay
well um i think i've got pretty good idea of my tour
uh you know what you've been very helpful jeanne
i think i've got everything that i need
so i'm very happy
thank you

okay
so i will handle the beach first alright
okay
no problem
would you like to a beach on an island
yes
have you heard of sentosa island
i heard it but i don't know how to uh i don't know much more about sentosa island
okay let me uh show you
okay
okay
okay
okay
so that is really number one um ideal tourist spot in sentosa
yes
yes it is easily accessible
and it has got other interesting places besides the beach
okay
okay
okay
so uh not just beaches for sentosa
no they are attractions of sentosa
okay
the whole island uh has been transformed into an island uh for fun for relaxation not only for tourist but also for singaporeans also
okay
okay
oh like uh amusement park
yes we have amusement park there we have uh resorts world singapore with uh universal studios
wow
that's interesting
yes
i heard about that
uh if you are not into rides and you know disneyland kind of uh background uh because i notice you're interested on the be about the beach
you can also visit an aquarium on the island where you can see fishes
yes
okay
okay
actually i'm open for any suggestions not like not such as beach
i'm open also for amusements um different tourist spot in singapore
okay
okay
so
but first thing on my mind is beach
okay
so here you are looking at uh view of the beach front side of the island which is off the
so this is the sentosa island
from sentosa island
yes
sentosa island and you can easily get across by shuttle bus that is provided by the la
okay
shuttle buses
yes
okay
uh let me go to siloso beach because i want to
siloso beach
uh siloso beach
i don't know how it got its name but i believe it's filipino for jealousy
jealousy
yes oh jealous
so that's the meaning of siloso
yes that is right
so here you can see some scenes people playing uh not uh badminton but volleyball
badminton
volleyball
no it's vol yah on the beach normally they play volleyball
because if there is a breeze uh yah
i think your uh shuttle cock might blow away into the water
okay
but there are no okay
yah but uh normally they play frisbee right
uh yes frisbee also
yes on the beach
definitely frisbee
okay
oh okay
uh and if you enjoy volleyball if they are playing you and your friend can also ask to join them
they would be happy to invite you
uh so
yah
okay
but nor
but normally frisbee uh one of the favourite sports
yes on the beach
so if you bring along a frisbee you and your friend can enjoy playing that also
okay
okay
so i can see a volleyball
hm you can uh
they play volleyball
yes uh that's when uh group of friends usually on vacation during the school holidays
so that's on so that's on siloso beach right
yes siloso beach
and i'm going to uh bring you to underwater world which is just uh from the beach you just walk to uh underwater world
wow
okay
underwaterworld
is it from sentosa island again
yes it's all on sentosa island
from siloso beach
yes and you notice there's also a fort there
can you see siloso point
so we will do underwater world first
they're all in the same location
yes
okay
okay
so i see dolphins
yes yah
there's a dolphin show and you can
okay
so some tourist go there to go some dolphins doing a show
uh dolphin is an add-on to the show
uh the
okay
so that is a part of uh siloso beach
uh no it's part of underwater world where you it's uh yah
yah it's a big aquarium and it's unusual because i believe this was the first time and it started what
uh twenty or more years ago that you also become uh an exhibit for the fish
uh because in the aquarium uh in the sunken section you walk stand on a travelator around uh that goes around the aquarium and that means there's gigantic fish tank all around you
underwaterworld
okay
okay
fish oh ah okay
so it's like um ocean park here in the philippines
yes
uh i haven't been to ocean park but uh if you have the same technology now i think they have the same idea in other parts of the world
but uh when it first opened uh we were told that singapore was the first one
so where you see the uh
oh okay
okay
so this is the undewaterworld
yes the dolphin lagoon is
lagoon
uh dolphin lagoon is outside the aquarium it's part of underwater world
and you can see the dolphins performing
okay
performing wow
and if you like you can also pay a small fee and you if you don't mind getting wet go down and uh play with the dolphins
just a little short while you know
because dolphins are very friendly but we don't want them to be you know uh too long with humans
they need to be with the dolphins
okay
wow
is it accessible to go surfing
uh surfing i'll have to check that out
oh not on sentosa island
sentosa island isn't um you know the beaches are very calm and uh yah
surfing you need to have very big waves right
to the beach
okay
calm okay
yes
uh singapore our island is uh a port and part of the reason it is attractive to the shipping uh community in the very early days when people use fishing bo uh sailing boats is that the waters here are very calm
we are protected by nearby islands
okay
okay
but we can okay but we can also rent a swimming pool
uh rent a swimming pool
you can stay in a hotel with a pool if you like
ah okay
stay with in a hotel with a pool okay
so how about um some amusement parks
yes
okay sentosa is a huge amusement park
yes
like you said um it has some many amusement park
what sort of amusement are you looking at
animal and wildlife or theme parks
wildlife yah
wildlife okay
i'll get out of this and uh we'll go to one of my favourite places
actually three of my favourite places
so i'll go to their website
really
okay
so this is the website
yes this is the website
okay
and you'll be able to see some pictures
there are three parks manage by wildlife reserves the bird park the singapore zoo
both of which you visit in the day
okay
zoo
okay
it's an open zoo next to a reservoir
so it is very uh unusual
you don't see so many animals within cages uh yah
so you know zoos normally uh when you take photographs sometimes it's doesn't look real
but at the singapore zoo you can you know produce a photograph as though you are seeing the animal out in the wild
cages
okay
okay
so we can mingle with some animals take pictures
yes you can mingle with them
uh and let me get to the bird park first okay
okay
okay
no worries
so this is the wildlife website
yes for the wildlife website
the wildlife reserves
is is do hornbill
yes
have you seen hornbills
hm some pictures
here you see the real ones now
yes
there are uh very big aviaries where the hornbills are inside and they have successfully breed in singapore
so we have singapore citizen hornbills
okay
okay
hornbills
and uh we in fact have been so successful
we have release them into uh mainland singapore
that means they become naturalised already and maybe when you come down the shopping area you might even see a hornbill flying over your head
yes
so but here you can see the hornbills close-up
different varieties of them
okay so they have many horbi so different varieties of hornbills
yes so different colours
so i'm trying to show you a little bit more of the uh bird park
bird park
okay attractions
okay
so here you can see free-flight aviary
yes
so here you walk in and you can see the birds feeding
i will just going to walk
you go inside the birds are flying all around you
okay
so you're actually inside the aviary
and these feeding trace are very near the path where you walk and the birds are they are used to tourist and locals feeding up
okay
so we can also feed them
uh feeding
uh the food is put there for you take photographs
but if you get the schedule of the feeding time when you enter then you can time yourself to be at the areas when they are feeding
okay
okay
alright
sounds interesting
and if you are tired walking there is a monorail
in fact the only monorail in the world that drives into an aviary
so the monorails stops inside this big huge uh like a bird cage that you are actually inside
all the
okay
aviary
so this is applicable when i am tired walking around
yes that's right
or you can take the ride and then after that you have seen an overview at everything and then you start walking
yes
and now for feeding you cannot bring your own bird seeds
you have to uh pay a small sum from the keeper uh
oh so i'm going to pay to feed the birds
yes just a few dollars
okay
he will give you a little cup of worms
worms
yes
do you like to handle worms
not so much
okay when you carry the cup and the birds fly in and take it off the cup
but if you like to try you let the worms sort of tickle your arm and they come down and feed
so norma so normally they are feed worms
yes in this aviary they are fed live worms
live worms
yes so you know um it's a healthier food for them
yes
and all around you are fruit trees and trees that the birds feed on
okay
and you see the waterfall at the back of this picture
yes beautiful
yes it's very nice place for photography
so two of you going you can stand there and take photographs
yes my friend love to take photographs
huh
uh you can also walk up the hill of that uh aviary
it's a very quiet place
so there is a hill
uh the park is sighted on the side of a hill
so uh there are some areas that many tourist do not go to because you have to climb just a little bit uh
just a little bit
yah it's like um maybe two floors you know you're climbing two floors instead of taking the lift
and you those areas are very quiet
so if you sit there quietly with your friend he would be able to get very natural photographs of the birds with the trees in the background
two floors
okay
okay
because the birds stop and feed
so i see different variety of birds
and we also have uh shows
a bird shows
yes bird shows
some like hornbills
uh the bird show is a different variety of show
okay
let me see if i can get it
but in that place also
yes in that place also
okay
i see
so can you see some pictures here on your right
yes
uh this is in an open area and you get eagles hawks and falcons uh owls also swooping down just a few inches from the top of your head
so when you watch the show you and your friend must remained seated
you must remember that
okay
it's very exciting because uh they are very close to you and you see this girl on the right
yes
so i see yah um mongolia falcon tree
yes that is right
it's a uh a reproduction
so we don't have a mongolian person there but he's dressed like a mongolian
yes
so we try to give some information in these shows to tell you the background of how the uh hawks were trained
uh if you volunteer like this lady here uh you don't have to be uh lady
sure
yes
she volunteered yah
yes you uh this one you know uh she's uh probably a park worker because they used her for the advertisement
uh you can also volunteer and have them land on you because you are adults
if you are a young child they will not select you
okay
so she use it yes
okay she volunteered it for commercial purposes
no she is a park uh staff
i know her
yes i recognise her
she's one of the trainers of the birds
so i think uh instead of paying a model to model for this she did it but uh there are many people who are very happy to go up on stage and uh take photographs uh with the birds
a staff
yah
sorry
a staff can do
yah
you have to wear a glove
can you see where her hand is
where the birds is
and so that's a gloves
yes it's a very thick leather gloves
so you don't worry your the bird will not you know um hurt your fingers
so i see a mongolian uh like a mongolian trainer riding in a horses
yes and it was a sport um with the middle eastern people also
but you don't hire mongolian people
well not if they are singaporeans around there
not many mongolians in singapore
yes
yah i know
we also have shows for children but i mean this is more exciting show uh that you may want
yah for adults like me
yes that's right for adults
so
oh i see an owl
yes an owl
uh they actually show you how um you can train a bird
uh birds are very difficult to train
yah
so difficult to train
be yes i have seen the training sessions
some of the birds fly up the trees and they just don't come down
so
so it took uh about a weeks to train a bird
uh i'm not sure
i don't think a week is enough
okay
can i show you the other locations
the zoo and the um the zoo and the night safari
okay so do you have a tiger show or lion shows
uh no you just watch them
because those animals are very difficult to train
and we are we don't take risk with our tourist
but you can see a nude lady here
i don't know if she's a lady
do you see the picture
yes
difficult
yes
this is uh naked mole rat
naked mole
naked because it has got no hair
mole rat
yes
but she has big teeth
yes that is right
uh i'm not a scientist
but i'm sure those teeth have some reason
probably to dig the tunnel and also to get food
okay so some tourist got interested seeing this naked mole
uh that is like the latest attraction you know
ah so this is the latest attraction
so yes because i haven't seen it myself
for the wildlife
yes
so i saw a giant elephants
so yes this is one of the shows you can see
um and you can also participate at the end of the show by feeding
so you just pay a few dollars to the keeper and he will provide you the food
you must understand that this is to make sure the animals are fed with healthy food you know we don't want them to get
yah
feeding
yes
yah
so what if uh i want to sit on the elephant's back
yes we have elephants rides as well
so i can pay a little bit
yes you can also do that
not so high
no it's not so high because the ride in singapore is not a very long journey
uh i don't know whether you've taken this rides before
yes
hm not yet
uh it's a little bit bumpy
uh so the rides are not extensive
you know what i mean
because go to some other countries they go into the jungle and halfway if you don't like it you have to maybe complete the circuit
extensive yes
yes
so like in thailand elephant is most popular animal
yes that is right
yes
in fact i just went there and uh my uh nieces they went on the elephant rides
okay
uh you can also sit on horses
uh we have uh horses
horses
yes for that's for children um of up to a certain uh heights
and someone will lead them on the path
can you see this uh jungle breakfast with wildlife
okay
yes jungle breakfast with wildlife
uh yo
i saw an chimpanzee uh
no that's an orangutan
no uh monk orangutan sorry
yes
uh these are uh now that there are in singapore for a long time uh we feel confident enough to put them in the open but um in a certain areas
so uh lots of trees and trees that have fallen we've use them to create a pathway for the orangutans to climb and to walk
yes
okay
so we can feed them also
uh you don't really feed them
what you do is you take a photograph with them
okay
so you see you are eating a normal breakfast here
and the orangutan would uh have his own breakfast
because his basket there is full of fruits
yes
yah i sa with also with banana
bananas uh durian
have you heard of durian
yes
uh smelly food but very delicious like sweet custard
so when it's seasoned he gets to eat it
um the
so is this orangutan a female or a male orangutan
i can't quite tell
um sometimes when they come out they bring along their baby
then you know for sure it's a female
so after breakfast the trainer will invite you to go up and take a photograph with the orangutan
yes
wow
orangutan
so you just have to be careful not to touch the young
okay
uh or
so this uh singapore zoo can offer us uh breakfast dinner or lunch
oh yes there's a restaurant right there which is glass all around
so while you're eating you can watch
so different restaurants
uh it's a different restaurant
that we can choose
uh this is a programme only in the morning where you can take photographs uh with the orangutan
when you are having uh dinner or lunch uh you don't have this programme available
but we have restaurants within the zoo in air-conditioned areas if you think it's too hot or you may want to sit outside
so there is uh can you see the list of restaurants there
okay
okay
yes
pizzafari
so
so that's a pizza joint
there's a
a popular kfc restaurant
yes and ben and jerry's ice cream
okay
yes ice cream
and ah ming is the name of our escort orangutan who has passed away
and she was given
so ah ming are named after the orangutan
yes a female who was very popular and she's been buried at the zoo
if you like you can visit the burial spot
yah
burial spot
uh this is the restaurant there
so that is a year ago
i think may be a ye two years ago i'm not sure
yes
two years ago
so because
so this restaurant built um two years ago
no this restaurant no was built much longer but it has been furbished
but it has been given her name in honour of her service uh to the zoo in popularising the zoo
she was an ambassador
so in this restaurant you can get all kinds of food and outside the restaurant there is also um indian food there is chinese food
so if you want to eat quickly and uh move on then maybe you just eat just the area just outside the restaurant
and uh
much longer okay
okay
okay i see indian
i see
it's a big area
it's a big area and this is right where the orangutans are uh swinging around the trees uh so you can see uh the attractions and eat
you don't really waste time
yes
okay
okay so i'll show you the other attraction
okay
so we also have a river safari first
let me show you this
river safari yes
this is the latest
it's within the zoo and you
so when you say it's the river safari so there is a crocodile
uh yes there are crocodiles
we have crocodiles in the zoo you can look at within like one metre two metres you know
uh they are in an enclosure so uh they cannot climb up the wall
so it's a good view
yes
good view
so this river safari just opened this year
yes just opened
i don't remember exactly the date but uh just a few months
uh so it re-creates the um famous rivers throughout the world and the forest
okay
yah so
i see the amazon river the nile
the murray the mecan
yes the pandas can you see on the right-hand side
yes pandas
they will be coming soon to singapore
they are not quite here yet
okay so they don't see any pandas right now
not right now if you came
uh you have to wait for the announcements from the uh zoo
management
yes because they have to prepare the environment
uh pandas are very fussy about their food
they eat bamboo and we want to make sure that when they come here they are healthy they smile when you take photographs of them
yes
okay
yah
so uh you take a ride along the river and when you're taking that ride the keeper the person who was with you the guide will show you specimens from the zoo
okay
specimen of what animal
like um you know anima the snakes when they moult they leave behind the skin
snakes
yeah
so it's impossible for us to see it because in the forest people would walk on it but you would be able to see this is dried out
because the keepers pick it up from the uh snake enclosure and then they dry it out
so you'd be able to see things like that
skulls of animals
okay
skulls
so is there a pictures of specimens here in the website
pictures of specimens uh i'm not sure
let me try conservation
conservation
yah
oh here you get a close up of the orangutan
orangutan
yes
so is this the orangutan named after the restaurant
uh no this is not ah ming
so i think this is another orangutan
uh ah ming is so famous
we all know her photo
we all know what she looks like
oh okay
okay
so i thought okay
so this is the conservation
and education because uh the zoo participates in helping not only um wildlife in singapore but also uh other places in the region
region
yah i um
yah i um we want to encourage singaporeans to be conservation conscious
and so we have programmes for the schools where they go there and uh it's a special programme where the
special programme
the keepers are trained to teach them to be uh aware of the need for a natural environment
yah
so this is two programme conservations
so wildlife conservations breed some animals
yes
you can see how many we have bred
orangutan golden lion tamarin uh
oh and even king cobra
yes king cobra
uh we have a walk-in snake enclosure
uh do you like to see snakes close-up
hm not quite
uh if you don't have a phobia of it you can walk through because i have done it
uh the snakes are usually the tame variety the ones that don't move around and go after humans smell
so they are on the trees they are around you
so it's quite exciting uh to see
but otherwise you don't have to go through there yah
uh we have white rhino
okay
yes
rhino
yah and
malaysian malayan tapir
yes
malaysian malayan tapir you can see close to you when we visit the night safari
night okay
so with this breeding programme we exchange some of the uh animals where we have uh very many with other zoos
so so this wildlife reserves of singapore opens twenty four hours
oh no uh the zoo is for diurnal animals
that means those are uh active in the day
the day okay
so it will close um uh about six i think
five p.m
six about six yes
six
um and if you want to go to all three parks like the bird park zoo and night safari i suggest uh you go to the bird park in the morning and then you go to
okay
bird park in the morning
yes
and then you go to the zoo and the zoo is next door to the night safari that opens only at seven thirty
so you can eat if you're hungry your dinner at the zoo
and then just a short walk about ten minutes away across the car park to the night safari
or you can walk across to the night safari and there is a dining area that they allow you in earlier
okay
yes
okay
so we can eat dinner there they will allow us
yes
yes there are restaurants there and there are um something like fast food you know
uh burgers uh
fast food
like kfc
oh no not kfc
they both the zoo and the night safari and bird park they manage their own food and beverage
yah
so uh where the restaurants are concerned uh they run the restaurants themselves
so if you see like ben and jerry's okay then they have allowed ben and jerry's to operate there
okay
operate there
but the restaurants proper are run by wildlife reserves themselves
okay so so how much um cost for visiting the singapore zoo
okay i come to the pricing in awhile
let me bring you to the uh night safari first
okay
so night safari is one of famous
yes it's very famous
have you heard about it before
hm no
okay because it is a zoo that shows nocturnal animals
nocturnal
yes
so here you see remember the malayan tapir that you saw
malayan tapir yah
uh they were bred in the zoo and we have quite a few of them
they are also nocturnal and diurnal
that means you can see them in the day and at night active
yah
i saw a big ride
yes uh
along
you the tram that is uh painted like a tiger it can bring you around the zoo uh sorry the night safari
and then you
yes
night safari
yah you get off and here the leopard trail
leopard
yah you have to walk
i see the leopard
yah for the giraffes you can see um just you know on the tram you can see because they're very tall
and the tapirs you can see because they are roaming around
but for the leopard you have to get off and walk
and you see this couple
yes
uh there's actually glass between the leopards and them yes
and uh we put some food nearby so that they will be there where there is light
leopard
okay
so some people think you see the background is very dark
dark
yes
but you see when the leopards come i think the leopards also think that the couple there is uh nice for eating you know
nice
so they come near
uh but the glass is very strong
uh so where we have animals like tigers leopards lions
um the enclosure is very secure
tigers
so they conserve so they conserve also this malayan tapir
uh yes
malayan tapir because it's indigenous to the region
it uh has been breeding successfully
okay
and uh giraffes i think giraffes we just had baby giraffe if i'm not mistaken
yah
so there are some wow
so you conserve
so sometimes the tapir will come in the front of the tram and then the tram cannot move
because it has to wait for the tapir to across the road
yes
to wait
the only thing is you cannot take photographs when you're in the night safari
okay
so is this uh also the only the pictures of malayan tapir and giraffe
so is there any pictures of animals
okay let
a nocturnal animals
uh pictures of nocturnal animals let me see
leopard trail okay
let me show you the shows okay
shows over the night
yes this is creature of the night
it's very exciting
so you should
so it's different creatures of animals
okay here before you enter just now you saw a short flash of a tribal show
tribal show
oh i see
a boa
yah
and yes the pictures keep changing we can't control that
yes
uh so you can see the elephants
so this is a depiction of the tribes doing the dance with fire
uh you can volunteer for this also or uh you need to very strong because that uh
big
uh python is very heavy yes i couldn't carry it
uh python is very heavy yes i couldn't carry it
huge
yes
so this dance um during the shows
and this is the leopard hand
uh after the show
is this a fire
yes fire uh
a fire dance
yes fires because the background is dark
so with the fire you know fire eating
yes
uh you'll be able to photograph very nicely
get good photographs
so many uh tourist go there during the night to see some
yes during the night uh you can visit the zoo and then you just walk across the road to the night safari
so uh i would recommend better to eat at the night safari because when you're eating uh
it's uh when we eat uh we will saw a view of this show
yah you see the show and if there is a long queue people buying tickets and you haven't bought your tickets yet uh you can queue up and buy the tickets first before other tourist groups come along
because the night safari is very popular
okay
popular
yes and uh to control the crowd as you are walking in we have uh
so they allow some tourist to participate like carrying a snake
yes
uh it depends on your size you know
there wo when they ask for volunteers you need to
yes
because they are so big
uh that's right so big
heavy
but after the show okay i'm gonna show you try and show you some pictures of the uh
himalayan foothills
yah you see
so the whole night safari is divided into zones
so on the right side you can see the different zones
so as you pass by you'd be able to see these animals
okay
yes
nepalese river
so from the himalayan foothills so this would be the animals you get at the himalayan foothills
the guide on the tram will draw your attention to where they are
okay
okay
so this is a rhino
yes
um this rhino looks as though he is wearing an armour
he's like these are armour plated you know
like he is wearing a metal suit
it's a quite huge
armour
metal suit
yes
it's a boy an old rhino
uh well he's been here quite some years
but i don't know his exact age
and we have a
so what kinds of animal this is like a dog
uh this is a wolf i think
wolf
yup wolf
uh probably wild dogs descended from them
okay from africa
uh this one is indians sub continents
okay
let see so africa the african animals are very beautiful
and they have stripes uh colours
yah
is this um what you call it
i'm afraid i don't know the name of this particular one uh
but this is from africa
yes it's from africa
so uh it's in the area of africa that is like singapore equatorial you know
so
equatorial yah
yah so can you see so it's hot and humid and red
so within that area we also re-create the zone
where we were uh the first slide we saw we try and build like cliffs for them
they are not real cliffs but we re-create the environment yah
have you see the tigers
so yeah not yet
okay it should be coming up on your screen
uh yah i see it
yes
in the day zoo you see the white tigers
white tigers
have you heard of yes it's a gene that is uh mutated long ago that they found in bangalore and then they bred it until we have a gene pool for tigers that come out white
so for
okay so you only have one white tiger
oh we have uh three white tigers
three white tigers okay
so there it's at the zoo
so you won't miss it
it will be on the trail as you are walking and so you can see their relatives here uh in the night safari
these are the natural
natural
yah natural
so tigers in fact uh can still be seen in malaysia our uh neighbouring country
but in singapore there is
so in the malayan
yah in the malayan region
india and uh malayan
in singapore they are extinct already huh
we can't have them roaming down the streets
malayan
yes
okay
so so here also so
the malayan tapir
uh that's the one that's roaming around
you have seen it already
okay i think this is the gar
it's a big like a buffalo
it's a big gar buffalo
yah buffalo
that's found still in burma
and we also have walking trails
okay so this night safari introduce uh some popular animals from different continent different country
yes that's right
uh yes different countries different continents uh
it sounds great because this is educational also
yes
i'm trying to find you the pricing
okay
so this is important the pricing
yes
okay
so if you are interested in all three attractions i suggest you buy a package ticket called the park hopper special
can you see it on your screen
okay
park hopper
yes that means you hop from park to park
you know what i mean
okay
you during uh for duration of one month thirty days you can use this ticket for all three parks
uh but uh we will be uh two days only
yes so you will not exceed the thirty days
two days vacation
yah
so
so i better use uh single purchase or individual purchase
that's right
so uh if i scroll down a little bit you can see uh see if you just visit the night safari the admission plus the tram ride would be thirty two dollars
okay
thirty two dollars
yes per person
but if you pay forty two that means only ten dollars more you'll get the bird park as well
okay
but if you pay fifty eight then you can go to the singapore zoo
park bird park night safari as well as the singapore zoo
jurong bird park
okay but what if uh we will just go to jurong bird park
oh jurong bird park then you just pay the fee a little bit lower than uh forty two yes
but uh you want to go back to jurong bird park
i think it's uh bird park under twenty dollars
forty two
okay
twenty dollars
for sure
less than that
you want to know the exact prices
sure
you're not interested in the night safari or the zoo
okay
let me see huh
okay
okay so yah i'm right twent uh eighteen dollars
eighteen dollars
yes that is right
so if you take the panorail ride remember i told you it's the only panorail ride that brings you inside the uh bird aviary
yes
where you saw the birds flying around
you add another five dollars then it would be twenty three dollars
oh so it cost five dollars for us to go to aviary
uh no it doesn't you the aviary is free but if you want to take the panorail ride around the park it's another five dollars
oh this is this is accessible when we go riding around the park
yes that's right
it will bring you not only to the waterfall aviary but to another area where you see lorries you know parakeets from australia
that are flying around yes
so you just get on you get off and you show your ticket again and you can get on again
parakeets
okay
okay so i get the pricing
so just now you remember fifty eight dollars you visit three parks
yes
and here if you pay eighteen dollars you visit one park
so if you don't want to take the ride it's only eighteen dollars
one park
eighteen dollar
so thirty two dollars when we go to uh what do you call the zoo the jumong
uh you're talking about all three
no uh only one
uh only one jurong bird park is twenty three dollars
twenty three dollars
but if i'm going to use a ride i'll just pay five dollars
yes five dollars
you buy the ticket in other words you decide at the time that you are buying the ticket and uh you just show the ticket
okay
it's quite interesting
okay so i get pricing
so how about the pricing of the siloso beach
siloso beach if you are just swimming it's uh two dollars to enter the island an
two dollars to enter the dollar to enter the island
and then one dollar for um taking the shuttle bus from the bus bay outside uh the island
okay so we need to pay one dollar
yes
when you come out you don't have to pay any money
okay
so you still have lots of money leftover from your thousand dollars
but hm is there any souvenirs that we can buy
uh lots of souvenirs you can buy when you're on siloso beach and also when you are at the zoo
for ex okay
so at this
uh sorry at the bird park
at all the three parks and at sentosa you can buy lots of souvenirs
yes
so in uh jurong bird park is there an hotel for us to stay
uh no not at jurong bird park but on sentosa there are hotels for you to stay
as so so like in siloso beach
uh yes
siloso beach you want to stay on the island
an hotel yah
okay let me see
because we haven't found you a hotel yet have we
yes
yes
you're only staying one night so we have uh lots of hotel
let's see
uh on the beach
just one night yah
yah costa sands is my recommend
costa sands
yes costa sands
is this famous hotel
yes uh in fact sometimes singaporeans check-in there during the school holidays
because it's just along the beach
you can just walk down the beach
okay
see it's on a hill overlooking siloso beach
so this is applicable for one person only or for couple or with friends
yes you ca yes you can
it's like a regular resort
you just booked the rooms there
okay so how much is it
can you see the price here
for so sixty nine
so eighty nine
eighty nine singaporean dollar
off-peak up til two hundred and fifteen
so i guess it depends on the time
okay so this is off-peak
yah it depends on the time you go
let me see whether i can get no i can't get the rates there
let me see
this is for the hotel
yes that's for the hotel
the pictures are appearing now
can you see uh the you only look at the one that says sentosa
okay
sentosa
the third one from your left
just wait
i'm trying to find the dates for you
yah
so downtown east
no downtown east is at another location
there are four hotels manage by the group
so when do you think you want to
yah
so you recommend me the sentosa
yes definitely sentosa
you are near to attractions and you like i said you could visit the underwater world
underwater world
uh yah what are your dates
i'm planning april five
then we can find out then april april five okay
five
that's a monday okay good
monday
april uh
yah
thursday
oh sorry thursday
we were on march yes
so five to six you're staying one night is that right
yah yes
okay so let's check out the prices
you have to be
so this is i think an off-peak season
yes off-peak because it's the middle of the week and it's also school term
okay
and you see the school term
holiday is in uh may yah
it's in may
so april the children are in school in singapore so nobody checks in
so you want to know the rate
holidays
okay
yes sure
okay
for me to decide
uh so one room with uh twin beds or double beds
oh you need to stay two nights
shall we check out the you have lots of money so you can stay two nights huh
ah okay
not so
because the maximum prices of the room is only two hundred over dollars
two hundred
yah so you said you have a thousand to spend
okay
yes
so can you see the pricing on your screen
yah uh deluxe room cost two hundred twenty nine singaporean dollars
yes it's daily rate so it would be two to nine
let say two thirty times two uh four hundred and sixty dollars
okay
but kampung hut is much cheaper
yes much cheaper
than deluxe room
yah yes
yah but this is applicable for two nights
yes a minimum of two nights
okay
let me think about it
so kampung hut
cause i'm with my friend
okay
so this kampung hut cost one hundred nine singaporean dollars
yes
it's uh less than half the price
this applicable only during off-peak season
uh it's during the time that you want to go that is the price
okay
the kampung
so this is for two to three nights
but we can only stay one night
so is there
are you able to extend your stay
because one night is not really enough time for singapore
and you have a lot of money for singap
no room
okay but but i better ask my friend about this yah
okay
but i'm quite interested with this
uh while
yah because you can stay there you can spend a whole day at the beach and visit the underwater world i was telling you about
okay
yes
um i'm adding up the cost
uh so twenty three for your bird park uh twenty five for underwater world
three dollars to enter sentosa
okay
underwater world
then one dollar to ride a bus
yah well including the one dollar is three dollars
okay
that's why i say uh you have lots of money
yah so i better consult first with my friend
yes huh
of course we won't do the bookings now
uh no
so i'll tell him about the package about the two night stay
uh actually we're planning only one night
okay
okay so
so you can see how much money you are spending
yah
so i'm better consult them first
okay
okay
and maybe we add-in let say it's a big um figure you will get your change back for taking the uh mass rapid transit to travel around by train and the bus
so allow thirty dollars per person
per person
yes
okay so i'll better check it first okay
okay

uh there is a certain things that we have put in place so that the animals will not uh escape from their premises
yah can i feed those uh
uh they

ulu ulu
this is ulu ulu as you can see it from your screen right now
it's a buffet style and also alarcarte
uh bongo burgers is another one but if you really like some uh quick fussy food like kfc uh you have to be a little bit early because the uh kfc usually close at seven yah

it's an observation wheel which takes uh visitors up for a ride uh so that they can have a good a nice view of the whole sort of part of singapore
this is the platform that goes up and down
no it's actually a wheel a big giant wheel
uh you can see let me see what i
uh it's like a ferris wheel
yes like a ferris
yah ferris wheel
how tall is that
uh the singapore flyer in fact is standing at the height of one hundred and sixty five metre
oh my god
that's too high
uh no in fact you won't not feel the height at all when you are taking the ride
you don't even feel that the wheel is moving at all
but i have fear of heights you know
you have fear uh okay
i can't
okay
uh then uh
you've some problem on the computer
uh what else um can you other
uh what about east coast beach
east coast beach is also a nice place
east coast
yah
uh east coast
do they have some water sports there
uh yes
we do have some cables uh cable skis which is available at that area
uh well wakeboarding

you can take the bicycle uh and take a ride along the beach uh will probably will cost you around by eight dollars an hour
you see we also have um family games
during the weekend especially there will be a lot of crowds which are there
volleyballs
yah
food wise uh you can also cycle and get some nice uh food our local food especially at the nearby hawker centre
yah this is the cable ski that i'm talking about that you can see it's a actually a cable which take them around on the east coast uh lagoon
wow
is that wakeboarding or
yah
it's not uh wind uh wind surfing boarding is also available uh at the east coast park
uh that's good
um and then what uh can i do this off in just two days
uh yes uh if you plan a
the schedule uh properly you should be able to do it
probably on the first day if you a what do you have in mind
you are like some beaches or you like some theme park or you like some zoo
so that i can help you to plan out accordingly so that you can have a nice uh you know holiday here with your girlfriends
um from an from the airport i want to go to what's the nearest
sentosa or the
if you have to say from the airport you do not have enough time
east coast which will be a nice place to hop in
yes
and then you go to the next nearer is the uh what's the next nearer from the beach east coast beach
east coast beach if the nearest the next one will be singapore flyer
if you are afraid of height then you probably would like to try sentosa which is also which a nice place to visit
or you can also go to the merlion park
okay
mer oh okay
then maybe the next day we'll go to oh about the hotel um
okay
uh now
for overnight stay
yah
uh why don't in this way
maybe on the first day when you arrive i would like to say is that hm you can try to stay in a hotel near to uh this in the city area
uh probably at the one that i suggested uh near to the city area
then if you want something cheap uh that would be about ninety dollars a day
you can see from the internet
and from there you can actually walk down towards merlion park which is about approximately about fifteen minutes or you can take a bus there as well
then uh from merlion park then if you have additional time probably you like to do some uh shopping uh along that particular way
yes
okay
ah okay
eh uh the hotel um ninety dollars is that already for two
uh ninety dollars is per room per night
how regardless of how many where were you
uh there is only two bed dens inside there or they call it twins sharing
uh
yah
okay
and then
then probably the second day if you prefer to uh catch uh the universal studio uh that will be able to fully occupy your two days in singapore
singapore
but if you like nature then you probably should try the zoo if you don't like the theme park
yah
uh ah okay

oh is it crowded or is there too many for va for a vacation
uh it's not that as i say
uh if you want uh to have a good nice holiday come during the weekdays it will be good
if you want to come during the weekend then you probably have to um have a little bit more time on waiting for your attractions
uh do they have the limit for the people coming in and out
yes
in fact in universal studio there is a limit for the uh people visiting inside the universal studio
uh approximately about eight thousand visitors a day
eight thousand a day
maximum yah
uh including same with weekends and holidays
yes
well i well i think it's big enough
yah they have a crowd control there so uh they if they exceed the number of uh visitors they will probably have to close the gate
oh how about the security
uh security wise we do not have se uh much issue on that uh usually inside universal studio we do have lockers available
for every attractions there are lockers available which is uh for the first half an hour is free but anything after that is chargeable

then eh hm where the hang on i'll just help you see the price of this merlion
uh hm merlion right
correct merlion
uh how about the cable car
uh cable car is uh just hang on huh
cable
it's actually hm
these are some of the attractions available in sentosa other than the one uh in uh resort world
resort world is part of sentosa but is on the other side of sentosa which has separate admission ticket
sentosa is uh another attraction which is located inside uh far from uh sentosa is actually the full island but the resort world is part of sentosa
wow
okay
yah
it's part

if you are staying uh near to orchard road there are uh some movie theaters are which are available there
uh the one next to the hotel which i uh say the budgeted hotel
uh plaza singapura has one of the movie theaters uh inside there
we call it the cineplex which has about eight theatres altogether
so you can catch any uh latest movie at that theater with very good sound system
hm by the hm
wow
well by the way um why did they why do they call it four d
i only heard of three d
now four d means that there's a four there are four different kind of effects you will get
one of them is the spects that you could wear it have a three dimension effect then uh the last one is the lights and the bumpy uh movement of the movie
so that's the other part and sound the sound the feeling of water if there's a water coming out from you will get some you'll get some sprinkle of water on your face
si
oh really
yes
so so that's the reason why we call it four d. if it's three d then you get three d effects three dimensional effect
oh wow
okay thank you
you're welcome
um can you show me the other
which one
uh more attractions
the other attractions
uh let me choose
um desperado oh how about the desperados
desperado
desperados are uh um hm

it's the same thing like um a four d movie but uh
the fourth one yah
yah
desperados in fact is something like a horse riding shooting game
it's actually
hm like antonio banderas

yah
but uh it's a little bit different now because they have um they give you a three d glasses
you can uh actually use it for your shooting hm
okay

oh you are thirty seven
okay so you are coming with your daughter then
s
yes
yes i'm planning to visit on september
okay
and do you have any budget in mind or take a places yah or places that you may like to see in singapore
oh we're travelling in a m by medium budget by one thousand do singapore dollars
will that do for two days
uh yes that also depends on uh which hotels you prefer to stay in a budget hotel or you prefer to stay a little bit much more premium hotel then you probably have less spending then
okay what is the name of the hotel you are recommending
alright
but first thing before i go to the hotel can i just find out a little bit more from you
like for example if you are here in singapore you like to do shopping mall or you prefer to goes out to some theme park as well like theme park like you know um some movie theme parks or some nature walk visiting the garden all things like that or you prefer something else
so that i can you know put you put it in a place or hotel whereby near to that place you spend less on transportation uh easy access to public transport so that these are the things that i will have to help you to consider uh and put you into the right place
so tell me then
okay okay
um i'm thinking of shopping for christmas ahead of time so i'm planning to go shopping a lot
alright
you plan to go shopping a lot
okay
and uh any other thing in mind in that other than the shopping
my daughter and i will like to go outdoors
we like
go outdoors
theme parks or probably to nature
uh any will do
any will do
alright
so if you are going for shopping then um it has to be somewhere nearby and if you prefer to go to theme park then it has to be also located somewhere near uh to the public transport as well
so uh do you mind um i'll like to show it to you one of the hotel which is quite budget and it's located um wait huh
okay
wait let me see uh
how is the weather like there uh on september
well in singapore here our weather uh the temperature wise um maybe from twenty six degree to thirty six degree
it's pretty humid here
so when you come to singapore try to wear some loose clothing don't wear thick clothing it will be a lot more comfortable for you
okay
right
uh like i no problem
thank you for that
so let me just see whether i can pick up that hotel alright
it's actually known as hotel um eighty one at rochor uh which is actually a two-star hotel it's a budgeted hotel
and in uh from you have a computer right
now you can you see from the screen itself where i'm putting this uh hotels up and
is that the merlion i'm seeing
no not the merlion
uh okay
okay
right
now if you were to take a look at the uh you're seeing the hotel you're seeing the hotel rooms right now or no
yes i do
yes uh so you can see the hotel room right
now if you were to see from the screen itself the room rate wise i'm trying to get the room rates for you so that you can probably budget your holiday here huh
right so for the room rate wise you can see it's hundred and thirty five per room per night right
so that will takes off uh two hundred and seventy dollars from you
so out of one thousand dollars two hundred and seventy dollars goes for that
and for shopping street um the hotel that you see here hotel eighty one is located quite near to the train system as well i'll just show you the map where the location of the hotel is yah
okay
okay
right
you can see uh from here the blue um uh bed which is here is actually hotel eighty one rochor
it's actually loated near to the station two train system station which is there
one is the little india station which we have the ne seven
uh from your hotel towards these uh station is not very far away probably around about ten minutes of walking you should be able to reach that station ne seven which stand for north east bound train station number seven
and the other one which is ew twelve that means that is a east west bound train station number twelve it's actually bugis station
so if you are staying in this hotel uh if you are putting up in this hotel
uh both of the access towards the public transport is quite convenient and not only that i you it's also located uh near to little india
that's where a lot of indian products are been sold there specially ladies accessories you know and you are travelling with your daughter with you so probably you can find something uh nice clothing of indian style
uh you can uh pick it out along this little india where the serangoon road is located
you can see this serangoon road
um i guess i just blow it up a little bit for you
okay
now i guess you can see it right now right serangoon road
the whole street which is along serangoon road is known as little india
many of these shops located at this area sells a lot of indian uh products from ladies wear to shoes from accessories uh anything you name it related to the indian community you have it there
so this is one of the nice shopping street you can find near to your hotel
the other one walking distance towards uh the uh rochor canal
you can see that there is another one which i put it the screen up here
bugis street can you see
okay
yes
yes
right
uh bugis street is also quite near to your hotel walking distance is approximately about ten minutes away only
and bugis junction bugis tower and bugis village here is one of the other shopping street that you can find uh near to your hotel
uh from the bugis street itself you can find varieties of um clothing
if you want cheap a little bit slightly much more cheap clothing uh maybe in reasonable price uh you can go to bugis village because those uh area they sells a lot of um t-shirts uh ladies accessories uh even for the guys if you need some watches you can pick it up from there
there are some a lot of watch uh dealers which are selling watches over there as well
and small little gift shops are also there
if you need to make up uh there is also uh hair salon located at that area
nice shopping street in fact
okay
how how many minutes again by foot
so
uh it's about ten minutes walk from your hotel
if you see from the hotel the blue in colour
now you can see hotel eighty one rochor
from there you can take a walk down and it's not very far away right
yah
yes
is it safe to walk to singapore
yes it's quite safe uh in singapore
um in fact nobody uh should bothers you when you are walking along the street so long as you know you don't um i mean uh during the night time of course uh we will suggest you not to outshine yourself by putting a lot of jewellery
or uh because um uh this people we uh in singapore here we are a very safe place but if you try to outshine too much and you're walking along the street then that is not very healthy for you or safe for you right
if you are wearing a decent clothing you know walking around the street nobody will bother you
in fact the policeman is out twenty four hours looking at every one of us
okay
oh okay
okay
ah okay
i i will remember that matthew
yah right
so um from here to any other shopping area is quite near
even it's uh even it's quite near to the hospital itself you can see there's a raffles hospital nearby
so in case anything uh really needs uh in needs of the medical attention there is also available nearby to your hotel so not very far away
food wise uh for food there's a lot of food courts available along your along the hotel that you are staying along jalan besar
and of course uh albert street here you can see albert street right
okay
okay
yes
albert street there is also another shopping mall very nearby
um there is one temple which is also a heritage temple that you should not miss in walking distance uh this temple here is known as the kwan im temple
we call it goddess of mercy temple very nice temple to visit
of course if you want to ask for blessing this is also a nice temple to visit yah
so uh shopping wise this is a nice area to be and of course uh if this this is the shopping part right
now the second thing you want is also for some theme park right
ah o okay
okay
yes
a theme park for you daughter especially she's sixteen years old she wanted to try something thrilling
i will recommend you for uh this sentosa
sentosa and inside sentosa we have a theme park here known as the resort world
uh resort world in sentosa is actually a theme park um located inside sentosa itself
yes
okay
there's a lot of ride if i go if we go there
yes correct
yes it's actually a universal studio located inside the sentosa
and this universal studio if you are coming in the month of september let me just help you up to see the ticket itself whether how much it's gonna cost you and of course travelling from your hotel to universal studio
uh if you remember just now there is a train station called ew seve oh sorry um ne seven that is from the little india
it will actually takes you to the harbourfront uh where the last stop is then you'll have to change uh this sentosa express to take you into the universal studio right
okay
yes
okay
so that is a lot more easier not so much of um walking to be done
so click next on your screen right now you are seeing uh it's actually a calendar of universal studio
now since you are coming in the month of september and it falls on the twentieth which is a thursday
uh if you go on a thursday the um ticket will be a lot more cheaper if you go on the twentieth
but if you go on the twenty first it will be a little bit more costly now because the friday is consider as a weekend rate
so weekend rate means uh peak rate so you'll probably have to pay a fee more expensive
okay
okay
yes it's more expensive
yes
so you can see uh on the screen itself the non-peak is actually sixty eight dollars for adults and child is you have to fall in the range of between three years old to twelve years old
so your daughter is sixteen years old i'm sorry you do not uh you are not entitled for the children
i'll be paying full amount
right
so uh she has to go on the adult fare
so uh i think i guess it would be around about a hundred and thirty six dollars
so hundred and thirty six dollars together with your two sixty uh three plus right
so if um you are going in onto this universal studio uh we also do have an express pass which is available
now this express pass of thirty dollars is add-on to your original ticket price of sixty eight dollars
the express pass means that you it actually allows you to access to a shorter queue inside the attraction
because you know universal studio is a very uh new attraction in singapore so many other visitors will queue up for their rides and by queuing it actually waste a lot of time so a lot of them may wanted to purchase the express pass to get away from the queue
so thirty dollars additional if you really want to jump the queue yah
but of course if not then you can have a full day there which is the universal studio op uh the operating hour is between uh nine forty five in the morning and it will end in the evening at seven
okay
yes
okay
yes
okay
i have a quest
so seven p.m. will be uh yes
i have a question for you matthew
i missed the part um how long again from e is it e twelve um the transportation
now from your hotel yah there are hotel transportation that you see on the screen is again you can see a ne seven
yes
yah
yes
from there
now
uh excuse me from there how long will it take for us to get to universal studios
uh in total of walking and uh waiting for the train it will approximately about half an hour
half an hour okay
half an hour okay
at the most
yes at the most yah
and how much should i pay for transportation
well if you are walking towards ne seven the transportation from ne seven to the vivocity where this uh sentosa uh express is is going to cost you at the most is about three dollars per person so you pay about six dollars
ah okay
oh okay that's fair
okay
yah
then from there if you uh from there you take um the sentosa express which is also another kind of train that allows you for admission into sentosa and then you pay three dollars more so total six
so in all in all you pay around about twelve dollar
six yah twelve dollar
okay uh okay
another question matthew
from the train station going to universal studios we're going to walk it or we're going to be in the place itself already
yah
if you are taking the train it will ends you up in vivocity which is the last stop of the train system
and from there you have to take another train which lead you into sentosa island
this train is only accessible from the vivocity itself
so the connecting train is in the shopping mall of the vivocity
so if you take the train from the sentosa express it's only costing you three dollars
okay
ah okay
ah okay
yah
okay i got that
okay
yah
so from there in fact uh if you finish your vis uh what you call universal studio you can also take back the same train to vivocity again where you can do your shopping again
because vivocity is also a very nice shopping mall to shop uh which i don't think you will miss i'll just give you uh an idea of this vivocity here alright
now vivocity is up here as you can see um this is the screen of the vivocity
okay
nice place to be nice shopping mall
okay
so how until what time is it open
yah
the shopping mall actually starts at ten and it will end in the evening at ten
ah okay
yah
so you can see getting there there are a few ways of getting
uh you can see uh the screen which is right now having by mrt can you see mrt
yes
yah
so take the north east line and alight at harbourfront
so the station that near to your hotel is called the north east line
so you will stop at this area here called the harbourfront centre
so only from here you take the sentosa express to the sentosa island
so it's quite near the minute when you come back again after you did universal studio you can also drop in in this shopping mall and do your shopping before going back to your hotel
okay
okay
how about the time of the mrt how long uh
uh well the mrt actually operates from morning uh it ends in the evening the last train leaving is at twelve midnight
oh okay
yah
okay
that's fine
right
okay how about other places to go to
uh other places to go to
right the um the uh the universal studio is what you want to know more right
or you prefer something else
ya uh yah
yes i want my trip to be memorable matthew
okay
uh if you're going for universal studio if you are buying the express pass you probably can end up in sentosa island again which is near next to the universal studio
uh you can also enjoy a beach uh show which is very popular in singapore right now we call it song of the sea
song of the sea is actually located in sentosa and i just uh put up this for you in sentosa yah
so in sentosa you can see um on your screen right now
okay see the sentosa
yes
alright
so sentosa is another uh park whereby uh you can catch the song of the sea in the evening
it's a very wonderful show
it's actually a laser show um with fireworks and waterworks
i just give you small outlook of the song of the sea uh for you huh
just give me uh coming
okay
that you should not missed because uh the show song of the sea show there's a limit to the show
um about two thousand five hundred visitors are able to get the seat for a single show
so for that show there are two shows happening in the day uh in the evening in fact uh seven forty and eight forty
additional shows only happens during the weekends saturday
so you can see um the normal ticket is at ten dollars so uh you can catch this that particular show before you end your trip uh in uh the sentosa
so that will fully occupy your full day in fact
okay
okay
here in this place sentosa there's a lot of things to do there already right
yes
you see uh from my screen here there's a lot of attraction which are here
uh we have the attraction at imbiah lookout
uh we have attractions at siloso point along the beach area and resort world
so you can see the resort world is the wonder i'm talking about of universal studio right
yes
yah
it's actually on the right hand side of your screen you can see universal studio
so sentos universal studio is located inside sentosa itself
so other than going elsewhere for um to take your transport by wasting a lot of time to get to the destination why don't you uh do the what you call the universal studio and at the same time finish up sentosa then
because sentosa is also a nice place to go
oh okay
okay
uh yah
if you have plenty of time then if you are buying the express pass probably you can also visit the underwater world which is located inside sentosa
but this sentosa underwater world only um opens from the uh nine a.m. to nine p.m. so you have to catch that timing
it's actually a nice place to be
but if you want your daughter to enjoy a little bit more probably you can uh put this sentosa in during the day time and enjoy diving with the shark package in sentosa underwater
ah o okay
can we finish that uh
and that will be nice
i think one day in sentosa is it enough to see all the places for a day
if you are not going for the universal studio i should say yes it's enough
oh okay
is my money enough
uh if you're going for universal studio then i'm sorry
wh
sentosa one day together with resort world not possible
how about my uh money matthew will be enough
will it be enough
yah if you see uh if you're not going to dive with the shark then i have guess uh it should be enough for uh less than a thousand dollars yes
okay
what is the good time for shopping there
what's the good time for shopping
yes
uh well
since i only have two days to spare for my vacation
you see as i say uh there are so many shopping centres around
uh the place whereby you are putting up is also a nice place for shopping
in fact you can get lots and lots of um clothing accessories for you and your daughter
and even if you want to become an indian for one day you can go to little india and uh have something on your hand put on the hand need to be drawn on your hand and see how it looks like to become an indian
yah
o i ha ah yes i have another question
most of the accessories or clothes are from india is it
uh they are not only from india but because the design are mainly catered to the indian taste
like for example if you uh the indian have a little bit more on the design of the god of uh the indian
sometimes they also have a necklace which been designed with uh the indian cursive uh floweries
so those are the design to the indian taste not actually made from india but some indian may have make it in europe
they bring it back to singapore to sell it uh to uh at that place
so there are retailer shops actually open at that area mainly catered to the indian needs not from india
yes
okay
okay
and when we get hungry there are lot eating or restaurant eating place or restaurants in sentosa
uh yes indeed there are lot of restaurant which are there you can see down here in sentosa
if you want to enjoy the dining at the beach area we also have you can dine indoors and outdoors
anything you name it you can have it
is it expensive to eat there or it's reasonable
uh if you are talking about dinning in the restaurant then of course uh it will be a little bit different compare to the street food or we call it uh the local food i mean the hawker centres and the food court yah
okay what um
because it's air-conditioner and it's a very good environment also isn't it
so you feel good
but yes it is
do they serve good food there
uh yes of course
even if you would like to try some of our local dishes like the hainanese chicken rice they also available uh at the hawker centre
so if you are staying nearby to this little india uh there's lot of mall which have air-conditioner food court
you can try all those uh local dishes at that area
sometime if you really don't find you probably uh and also very skeptical having the local dishes yah there's also a lot of western food available as well
yes
i see here italian and european meals they serve too
yah
yes
yes
how about this one
what if i'm going to take um the boat
the boat
yah
it says here island now boats for over fifty
the boat could take me to different restaurants
hm oh i are you looking at the same page i'm looking at
yes uh dine and shop
the sentosa
uh dine and shop yah
yes
yes
it says here from central business district the island now boats uh no i cannot i thought boats bought
i'm sorry about that
so there's only o
boats
yah that's why yah i don't see any boats here uh yah
yah that's why you were quiet
uh ya yah there yah you are telling me boats so okay no no i don't see any boats here
so there's no other way to go there unless i'm going to take the train and
there is some other ways you can take by the mean of public transport
you can have taxi are also available uh buses are also available
um those are the few option you can take yah
how how about by bus how long will it take
by bus is approximately um also amount about the same about uh thirty to forty five minutes yah
and how much will it be
uh almost similar like the train
so which is more convenient to take the bus or the train
yes
i will say train because because bus you need to stop every traffic light the train got no traffic light so he's just cutting across
okay
but but you said it takes the same time to get there if i'm going to take the bu
oh i see
the thing is uh if you're walking towards that station then it takes some time right
yes
if you are waiting for a bus you just walk towards the bus stop that which is not very far from your hotel then you take pick up the bus and go
but it's going to be take about thirty to forty five minutes alright
oh yes
but if you are taking the train then is a lot more comfortable because uh by walking towards train uh station there is the walking distance only
then from the train there is no waiting time for the traffic condition
if you are taking the buses then of course if there is a heavy traffic then you get congested the time may drag even longer
ah okay
so it's more convenient to take the train than the bus
okay
yah
correct
and how about if i'm going to stay in the hotel that you showed me uh is it is the breakfast included in the package
uh inclu i'm sorry that is a budget hotel so no breakfast is included
but uh the hotel which you are staying uh near to that particular area if you see on the screen now
you will find that along the street here there is a lot food court or we call it coffee shops available
coffee shops are uh they sell coffee in the morning uh they sell toasted bread with eggs half boiled egg or full boiled egg
sometime you can also get noodles and also if you like to try our indian style of breakfast we call it roti prata which is made up of flour
they fry it on the pan and it's quite tasty with if you dip it into a curry sauce
oh okay
yah
you can try this um near to your hotel and it's quite cheap also
for breakfast probably you pay around about uh three dollars you can get a good and nice breakfast yah
okay how about is it okay to change my money to singaporean dollars in my country or to your country
uh well it almost everywhere is the same
whether you change it in your place or you can change it in singapore it's still would be the same rate
so it's it's anywhere will do right
yes anywhere will do
okay
how about
you need not yah you need not to be in singapore
so everywhere i go there is a place where i could change my money right
correct
the place that you are staying uh at little india there's a lot of money changer as well so you need not have to worry
even if you are not changing that money right now you can get the money changer at any other shopping mall
there's a lot of money changer at the shopping mall so you need not to worry about your currency it's quite easy and convenient
okay
can you tell me how much is the curre or the rate if i'm going to change my peso to singaporean dollar
well there is a website that you can estimate the exchange rate but um you cannot use that rate as the fix rate
so it changes everyday
yes change everyday
okay
it's okay
yah so you have to check it everyday
okay so okay
and what are the places that i should not go to
the places to avoid
yah
yah
uh well there is uh no there is no places that you should not go to but um of course uh dark areas behind the shop houses you should not try to venture
okay
the dark places behind the shop houses is actually not good
but walking along the main street doing the shopping uh it's fine it's quite safe here in singapore
okay
so when we get hungry since we don't have uh breakfa
yah
yah
you didn't have to worry because along the way you can have burger kings kfc which is kentucky fried chicken mcdonalds is everywhere fast food is available
even if you are staying in your hotel if you're hungry intend not to get out from your hotel you can also call uh mcdonald they will deliver to your hotel
okay that will be great
so correct that is very convenient
oh it's very convenient
uh need not to worry you will not die on hunger
anyway i'm just go
i'm planning to stay for a day or two so i'm going to make the most of it
i'm going to make the most out of it um right
but how about the do's and don'ts what are the things that i supposed to do and things that i'm not supposed to not to do rather in your country
well uh ya yah i guess uh you have heard a lot things that what you should ask what you should do what you should not do but uh one thing just bear this in mind treat singapore as your home uh that will be good enough
because if you treat singapore as your home deffinitely there is no other places that you should what you should do and why you should not do
because uh if you treat singapore as your home you definitely don't throw litters in your home right
you don't throw papers at your home right
you don't spill all over the places at your home right
so you treat singapore as your home then nobody will fine you then there's nothing that you cannot do
okay
yes
yes
ah okay
so
but as far as if you i am i guess you are not a smoker right
no i don't smoke
yah
then that's fine because smoking in singapore there is it's not a ban but uh certain places are prohibited from smoking
so sometime when your friends tell you say that there are certain things that you should not do in singapore where one of them is smoking
no smoking is allowed but not in public places places like places at bus stop you are not allowed to smoke places in shopping mall you are not allowed to smoke
the reason is because they want to make sure that you know um you have to protect the interest of the public
if you are smoking the smokers will not uh have as bad um uh influence compare to the one who is not smoking right
because their second hand smoke will cause more damage to the non-smoker
but there are
so that was the reason why we have restrict them from smoking in the public area
oh but there are places where they could smoke right
yes there is
uh so long it's at the open air and it's not in and it's away from the crowded area it's fine
and now you are asking about the exchange rate it's on your screen right now
you can see this is how the exchange rate goes right now
uh okay
okay
okay
one peso is to
yah
so you twenty cents
twenty nine cents
twenty cent
okay
so how about the people there diverse culture right
so are the people in singapore friendly
uh yes
they are very friendly they are able to most of them are able to speak english
so if you use english as um the communication language there shouldn't be a any problem even from getting from one place to another most of the places are written in english it is quite easy to understand
oh that's great
yah
so it won't i won't have a hard time communicating with singaporeans right
no definitely not
if uh you do have give me call i will definitely help you up
okay that's great
ah okay
and how about other outdoors activity
so i could choose my itinerary if i'm going to travel on september twentieth
so i'm thinking if i'm going to take or if i'm going to go to universal studios or if i'm going to go to sentosa park
how about your safari
i heard that you have a safari in singapore
yes we do have a safari here in singapore the most popular one is we call it the night safari
the night safari in fact is something like a night zoo and it's coming up on your screen right now
this uh night zoo in fact showcase you about the um night animals
and during the night time most of us are in bed sleeping we didn't know what is going outside in the nature
what sort of animal are very active during the night time compare to day time like the chimpanzee are quite active during the day time right
yes
so you can see a lot of chimpanzee are very active but during the night time most of the chimpanzee are sleeping just like us
but how much will it cost me to go there
well there are some public buses which will take you there
if you are staying near to that particular place you can go there yourself by public transport or you can also pick up their express buses there
you can see uh getting there which i'm gonna click right now
and you can see these are some the pickup points uh from the city area
from the city area means from the nearby area
so since you are staying at little india the nearest place to pick up will be at hotel rendezvous
okay
hotel rendezvous
so uh you can just take a walk from your hotel to hotel rendezvous it's about another uh ten minutes you should be at the hotel rendezvous
or otherwise you can also pick up the uh train system uh from there
uh you can see if from here uh right
the mrt station you can take the mrt towards that area or you can even take the buses from here
you can see that the bus service number um nine two six and nine two seven nine two six and one seven one
it is located quite near to your hotel
so you can pick up those buses and go to night safari also
uh it says here it takes thirty to forty minutes to get there
correct
it's thirty to forty minutes because the bus need to travel from your area which is the uh the centre of the singapore all the way towards the north area it's approximately around about that time yes
how about um going back will it be difficult to go back to the hotel right after the safari tour
n um. no in fact the buses are available until twelve midnight the train system also available until twelve midnight
so if you want to if you would not be able to catch those two you can also catch a taxi which is also available the last mean of transportation to go back yah
but i won't have m
and to get a taxi
i wouldn't have money for taxi
don't worry mostly the taxi fare if it's you are taking taxi probably it will cost you around about uh thirty five dollars
oh that's expensive
right
yah
but otherwise you can just leave a little bit early just uh before eleven you can leave
but usually if you go to night safari we usually goes around about five thirty or five p.m. because night safari is open at seven but uh when the drive bus journey takes you there it will be just nice for you to get around to take some nice photograph before the night safari opens up the gates uh for you to view
yah
so by the time you finish um your attraction inside night safari it should be around about ten
um it should be fine for you to get uh to your hotel without any problem
ah okay
so how long will it take for us to finish the safari tour
okay that uh really depends on you
for a normal person you will finish around about three to uh three and a half hours you should be able to get done with it
okay
so if i want if we want to go there we will we should be there before seven right
yah
correct
okay
how about other places what other places can you recommend
how about um
well if you like nature singapore botanical garden will be a nice place to visit
it's actually free of charge
and from your places to the um now i got from your places to that uh singapore botanical garden
there is also a train system available
so if you were to see from the map here on the screen itself you'll find little india at that particular station over there
so if you take the train system down uh all the way towards yah the uh sorry
if you take the train system you can also lead towards botanical garden
it's quite easy and convenient
okay
okay
oh okay
so yah you can take it down all the way towards the uh dhoby ghaut station change the train up there or you can take the yellow um the bras basah line all the way one round towards the botanical garden
so the train fare approximately i sup going to be around about two dollars per person
so botanical garden will be a nice place to visit as well
is it free of charge
yes botanical garden is free
and of course uh let me just pull up botanical garden for you alright
how about merlion what does it mean matthew
uh right
uh merlion is actually an icon of singapore
it was only created in nineteen seventy two the park is created in nineteen seventy two
the lion head symbolised the uh founding of the island and of course the fish body just symbolised the humble fishing village
so uh that was the reason why we put it together and called it merlion
ah okay
right
that is a symbol for singapore right
ah yes indeed
yes
we use that to symbolise singapore
yah there you are that's the singapore botanical garden and this is yah
this is uh how to get there
you can either go by three ways the mrt which is the circle line which i have told you about just now
you can see the yellow line
it's very nice
yah
and you also can get um down by foot from your hotel uh to take a walk there it is not convenient but you can take a bus directly from your hotel
there are these buses here you can see via bukit timah
that will be the buses available for you to pick up to the singapore botanical garden
and it opens during the morning five a.m. all the way to twelve midnight
but uh if you are visiting singapore botanical garden you should not miss the national orchid garden
it's a very nice garden uh with lots of beautiful flowers
i guess your daughter and you will be enjoying the photography session inside the national orchid garden
yes
yes
so there is a fees for you to pay in order to get admission again it's five dollars per adults and children have to be below twelve
again i need to pay five dollars for her as well
yah
correct
if you are going into the national orchid garden
if you are not then the admission for the botanical garden is free of charge
okay
will it be okay to take photographs or to take our pictures there
yes of course
that's the reason for visiting attraction right
uh you can take
yes
but some places it can
there are only there yah there are some places like the night safari
the night safari uh photography is allowed but flash photography is not allowed
uh because during the night time some flash light from the cameras may harm the animal so it may cause the animal to run into danger
so that is the reason why flash photograph are not allowed inside the night safari
oh i see
how about from the airport going to the hotel that you're talking about you're recommending how long will it take from the airport going to the hotel
yah
uh it will approximately about half an hour to forty five minutes yah
so we could take the bus or the train as well
i will suggest you to take the train it's a lot more easier
okay
so if we're going to take the train from the airport it will take thirty minutes you said
yah thirty to forty five minutes
because the minute when you uh get out from the airport the train system from the airport is to this station called tanah merah interchange whereby you have to walk across the other platform to pick up the other train towards to your hotel
so
thirty to for how long how long if you're going to walk it from the airport
not it's uh from the airport there is a direct train from the airport to the tanah merah interchange which is um about five minutes of uh mrt ride yah
oh so it will not be difficult to locate
no
okay
not it's la and not difficult to locate
and how much will it cost again from the airport going to the hotel
from the airport to the hotel it's approximately about two to three dollars because you need to deposit one dollar additional for the ticket
it will be refunded to you immediately after you get exit from the train station and get a refund from the machine by slotting in the ticket back into the ticket machine
it will give you the refund of the deposit of the ticket itself
ok okay
and from the hotel it takes us thirty to forty minutes if we're going to take the train going to sentosa and universal studios right
yah inclusive of this waiting time or waiting for the uh train to come waiting for while you're walking
so that is uh taking into consideration
but is it confusing to read your maps or
no it's quite easy to read our maps
if you see the map here which is on the screen right now
you'll find that the little india is there that's where your hotel is right
yes
do you remember
yes
yah right
so from little india if you were to see it's quite near to bugis and bugis is the one that is the one that you see on your map it will leads you all the way to changi airport
can you see changi airport
yes
on the right hand side which has a number three there
yes
so changi airport has um a train system which will lead to tanah merah you can see tanah merah there and that is an interchange that you have to change a train just by walking across the platform
it will takes you all the way down uh towards the uh what you call uh the bugis area where you can walk towards your hotel
your hotel is in between little india and bugis
so it's quite near you don't have to worry
okay
it's near
and that's the o changi is it
changi
yah
yes uh changi airport
changi airport is the only airport that you have international airport
we yes this is the international airport
we do have three airport but this is the only airport which uh have uh flights coming in from uh passenger flights coming in
the other airports are mainly for military use and also meant for private jets and not for big uh passenger aircraft
and one more thing what do you suggest uh should i reserve or my booking online on a if i'm going to stay in the hotel and or
yah
yes i will suggest you to get it done uh from the internet itself because um only when confirmation are there then they will give you the room
okay
and from the hotel there's a lot of places if we're going to walk it we won't get hungry right
uh no definitely not
you there's a lot of uh food court coffeshops are available restaurants are also available so uh don't worry
ah okay
and
food everywhere
and lastly if i want to see the temple i could see the temple along the way that you said a while ago right
yes
yes correct
okay
anything else that you would like to recommend matthew before i go
well you only have two days so i have given you the choice i have given you four choice to choose
okay
you're very helpful
right
you are most welcome
it's my pleasure
okay
and i will visit your country on september
thank you
i hope to see you soon
and should if you have any more query you can uh feel free just to drop by me again uh i'm happy to share it with you again yah
alright
alright
have a good day matthew
bye
same to you
yah alright bye bye
bye
hi good morning
hi good
my name is mathew
yah good morning
uh i'm sorry
um i didn't mean to uh cut you off there
uh but what's your name
my name is mathew i'm the tour guide three uh speaking to you right now
how can i help you today and
how can i help you today and
oh well hi there mathew
i'm participant number forty eight and my name is ralph
and i'm planning to uh have a short trip uh in singapore
i was hoping you guys can help me out
alright
uh firstly can i know when will you be travelling to singapore
i'm looking at next week um saturdays and sundays
saturday and sundays
and do you have any budget in mind that you like me to assist you accordingly to the budget you uh propose
well i'm looking to spend up to uh one thousand us dollars but any savings uh would definitely uh um i mean uh um be very help i mean i'll be very happy if you guys can uh help me uh to uh save some
alright
uh first thing um you need uh do you need a hotel to say in singapore right
or you have your planning of your own hotel
mo most likely because uh i mean to be honest with you uh this will be the first time that i'll be uh visiting the country
so i don't have any of friends there or relatives
so well you know i may have to uh look for a hotel
if you can help me out to find a uh better hotel that will suit my budget that wil be great
alright
okay usually uh you plan to travel by the means of public transport like the train and the buses
or you prefer to travel in a little comfort with taxi
well that would really uh depend
um how much is a taxi cab there
alright in singapore most of the taxis are run by metre
uh the maximum it will go from one place to one end of singapore to the other end will cost you around about forty singapore dollars to forty five dollars
um can you uh tell me the uh equivalent of that to uh us dollars
um usually in singapore we only use singapore currency
so if you were to use us currency you probably have to multiply by one point two
so the exchange rate is one point two huh
correct
okay that's very expensive
then we go by the mean of public transport which is the train system and the bus system will be good
so you have buses and trains
yah
okay
right
um but for a first-timer like me uh would it i mean uh you know i'm just uh afraid that it may be difficult for me uh to uh use your public transportation
no problem i'll assist you out
and i'll teach you how to go around
and uh before i proceed i need to find a few things from you
one is uh what do you have in mind uh when you uh come to singapore
you like to visit some of the attraction or theme park or you prefer to see some nature or you prefer to do a little bit of shopping on electronics or you buy something to give back home for your families
in fact there i will have to consider eh your needs so that i can place you at the right hotel where you will save up on transportation cost and also um for food wise where can you pick it up uh as well
so that was the reason why i'm asking this question right now
okay
well it's a small county
um was hoping to do uh well i was hoping to uh maximise my visit there so all those things that you mention i'm all for it
just as long as uh you can provide uh itineraries for uh those for that two-days stay
um but um i was uh thinking of uh visiting um you know historical landmarks if you have one
and i'm an outdoor type of person so if hm theme park is nice
um if you have um beaches and resorts i would to love uh hear uh the rates as well uh for those places
right
now um for you budget if you are going for a thousand dollars uh in singapore i'm very sure that you will not be able to get uh a good beach resort
uh and transportation wise from the beach to any of the attraction which you would like to visit is not advisable because uh the transportation wise is not very convenient from the beach area
so probably you will have to look at um maybe taking somewhere in the city area where the train systems are available and they will be probably helpful for you to move around in singapore uh at uh a budget cost
really huh
yah
um well first things first uh let me uh see i mean uh i want to uh know how much are the uh hotels are for to singapore on average
okay
right
uh right now i'm actually um i guess you are having a screen share with me right now right
yah
alright now can you
that's i thought you know of asking you about the hotel because uh i'm working at the uh map right now
alright
first thing uh i would like to just put it up to you that uh there is a hotel which i'm looking at right now which is called hotel eighty one bencoolen
and this is actually a budget hotel
uh they have no breakfast in this particular hotel
but um next to the surrounding of the hotel there is a lot of we call it food court or coffee shops are there
okay
so that means that in the early morning instead of getting your breakfast in the hotel uh which is hm uh which they don't serve uh breakfast you can pick it up at the next door where the coffee shop is
we call it coffee shop is basically because in the early morning and throughout the day they do serve coffee tea and you know cakes uh toasted breads
those things you can get it there at a very cheap rate
but are they open twenty four hours a day
uh some of the coffee shops do open twenty four hours
some of them they only operate from the morning as early as six in the morning
and then they probably finish their business in the evening at around about nine to ten yah
okay
so uh with this hotel i'm pretty much uh just um renting a room
so eh renting a room is um we don't have those kind of uh we do have those backpackers room but it's not advisable to have a visitor first time
you try on the backpackers room
probably you get
uh i'm sorry what was that room again
bed
backpackers
we call it a backpackers
oh backpackers okay
yah correct
so where do you suggest
probably a hotel like this uh hotel eighty one at bencoolen that would be good for you
you can see that the room rate wise is about hundred and ten dollars per night
and it is not really very costly
if you are staying for two-night you probably pay around about two hundred and twenty dollars at the most
but what do i get for uh a hundred ten a night
you know just the stay
so and yah
yah just the stay
you can see this is the hotel
you can see it from your screen right now this is how the hotel looks like
alright the bed is slightly a little more comfortable
right and
well it they looks comfortable but i to be honest with you i think it's kinda expensive
yah
yah
no in fact is hundred and ten is quite cheap uh if it's located at the city area
and moreover you can see from yourself from the screen right now i'm loading it up for you
and if you see uh carefully on the map itself
it is quite accessible um to the public transport
okay so this is located at the uh main city
yes located in the city area where uh most of the public transports are available
okay sounds good
okay you can see from the map right now um the blue uh icon which is here
uh it's hotel eighty one bencoolen
it's a two-star hotel
if you're going for three-star then it will be a lot more costly
so that's why you're going for a budget hotel
yes you can see down there it's written down there this is a budget hotel right
compare to the uh normal hotel you're looking at
so and it's not only that it's close by to the train system
there are three kind of train system which is available there you know within the walking distance
so dhoby ghaut is the station which have three trains linking together
the cc one and ne six ns twenty four
uh these are the kind of trains connecting train
that means at these area it's an interchange of trains
so if you were to travel going to uh northeast you have the northeast line there
if you are going to uh north-south then you have the north-south train station
you also have the cc one which is circle line train system
so it's all nearby and not only that you can also uh take a walk towards the ew twelve which is on your map
this is the east-west bound train
it's very simple to identify
uh ew means east-west
twelve means station number twelve
so this is uh how nearby it is uh to your hotel walking distance
so probably from east station uh from the station dhoby ghaut station to your hotel probably about hm ten minutes walk
and then maybe from your hotel to the east-west bound train another fifteen minutes walk and that's it
okay
okay
what are the other things they offer at the hotel
i mean do they have uh a pool casinos
right
uh no this is a budget hotel
so definitely you would not be having uh those kind of facilities uh like the swimming pools and all those staff
because if you are looking at swimming then you have to have a full-fledged hotel or something like a three-star or four-star hotel
then you'll have all those facilities
okay
uh how about food
um i mean do they serve any type of uh dishes if i mean if i get lazy uh to uh get out
right
eh in fact this hotel do not serve uh food
they only uh rooms available only
you can see it from here these are the hotel facilities here
uh there are bars and pubs which are there
but uh
but okay but uh can i request them to uh fetch me some food
yah
you see uh in singapore here it's quite convenient
if you are quite hungry and you don't wanna get out from the hotel room you just need to do is to dial uh for their food like mcdonalds uh kentucky fried chicken um you know pizza huts
and those are available through a phone call away yah
okay
um but is it the same uh with all uh with all those uh food chains uh are there any uh delivery charges
so when the uh well there is a delivery charges for some of the uh fast food
like mcdonalds they do charge uh a service charge of two dollars
okay
yah additional two dollars on top of your uh food order
okay
so it's uh quite reasonable
it should be okay
you can see that uh the rooms are all so internet access there are safe deposit box which are there
wi-fi in public area shops are there uh laundry self-service are there elevators are there
so the only thing is it's a budget hotel so it does not have swimming pools and restaurants
okay
well i got a question uh with wi-fi in public areas
um so i uh wi-fi is not available in my room
uh wi-fi is available in your room but uh you can see down here it says internet access wireless complimentary
that means that it's free inside your room
that okay i didn't notice that
yah
yah
and the laundry service is that for free
no laundry service is not that for free
eh you have to put laundry service are chargeable
um you have any idea how much it would cost me
uh maybe it goes by uh per unit basis
maybe will cost you around about four dollars for washing and drying
okay
and one of the uh safety deposit boxes can you uh tell me something about that
yah
safety deposit box usually is uh free of charge
usually it's free of charge
because uh you can put the safe deposit inside your room
uh there is a small little safe deposit inside your room
okay
yah
well uh the hotel seems like a good fit to uh what i need
uh but gotta ask you i mean uh do we have any other alternatives
okay
uh yes we do have the other uh hotel which is also uh hotel eighty one uh put up a little bit where the uh rochor canal road is
there is also another hotel called hotel eighty one
uh let me just bring you back here
oh i think wait huh
by the way i am planning to uh have someone with me on this trip
so i'm looking at eh um a couple's room
yah
okay
a couple's room
alright
so you know i mean with the hotel eighty one the first one that you uh showed me um the hundred uh ten dollar fee is that for a single room or is that a couple's room
it's a couple's room
it's a twin bed there or you can also request for a king size bed or queen size bed
well good
okay
yah run this thing up
but while you are trying to allocate that other hotel let me just ask you uh
i mean how's the uh weather there
is it very hot
yah
yah
uh singapore weather uh the temperature is ranged between twenty six degree to thirty five degree
uh usually highest you can get uh thirty six but we do reach thirty six sometime
hm okay
pretty humid
yah it's quite humid here
okay
right
um i don't think there
so uh are all of the uh rooms in your hotel are air-conditioned
yes the hotel rooms are air conditioner
so you need not have to worry about
okay
yah i just wanna be sure i mean
uh i don't wanna feel uh thirty six degrees inside my room
no of course not
okay
okay here we are we have another hotel here which is a three-star hotel known as the fragrance hotel
and let's see whether do it uh
is that in the same area as hotel eighty one
right
yes it's quite near to hotel eighty one so the room rate is about hundred dollars per night
so it's about ten dollars lesser only at the most
it is also quite near yah
really uh and this is a three-star hotel right
yah
okay
so why is it much cheaper than hotel eighty one
so you can see it's located yah
alright you can see that uh fragrance hotel is a little bit outskirt uh from the city it's quite near to the edge of the city
then i would say uh going out away from the city
ah okay
yah it's located some yah
that is the reason why uh it's uh slightly cheaper compared to the hotel that i'm talking about just now
and you can see there the distance from this hotel uh to the train station where i show you about the dhoby ghuat it's a little bit further away isn't it
or don't you think so
well how long uh will take me uh for you know to uh get to that station
how many minutes for a quick walk
you either you can take the other station which is quite nearby which is only the train system called it ne seven
the ne seven is a northeast bound train
station number seven it's a little india station
you can take the train system from here
uh it will lead you back to that station which is called the uh dhoby ghaut station
the only difference is that this is near to only two station that is near to three station
uh i would say four station
that means there are connecting trains uh available just at the site
so even you were to go to the north you can get train easily even you wanna go down to um at the west there's also some connecting train which is available
so it's like you know it's quite convenient compared the um uh this hotel that you are staying
eh there is only two trains that you can pick it up
one is a northeast line the other one is the east-west bound train uh line and that's it
so same thing uh northeast line will takes you about five minutes walk towards that station
and ew will takes you another about ten minutes walk to that particular station
okay
yah
i'm liking the sound of that
uh what about the uh facilities
so you huh
we are uh i'm asking about the fragrance hotel
sorry i cannot get yah
what are the facilities there
i don't mind walking really
so eh anything uh that will be cheaper for me i'm all for that
okay
okay you can see that this do come with uh this do come with a small little pool yes
there's small little pool restaurants are there
okay
yah
and if you are coming with your girlfriends then uh superior room will be good for you
so okay
so what do i get uh for my hundred dollar stay
sorry
what do you get your first your one hundred dollar stay complimentary
wha yes
coffee will be serve to you um i guess breakfast
i maybe i let you see whether there's breakfast for you
okay
i guess hundred dollars is not with the breakfast
uh we'll wait and see
uh no i don't think there is breakfast here
but they do have a restaurant inside the hotel right
uh no they do have breakfast
they do have breakfast if you are taking the executive deluxe room
the superior rooms are not with breakfast yah
oh i see
okay
yah
so hundred dollars is pretty much the uh stay right
no hundred dollars yah
it's for the lodging right
correct
okay
but what type of food do they serve there
yes it's for the lodging
so you can uh coffee tea uh some sandwiches are there
uh that's it
and not like this
um are there any uh specific dishes
uh i mean do they serve indian food chinese dishes
that is usually the in the hotel wise the restaurants are there
uh usually they serve the local uh we say the uh ancient asia uh deli uh food that is uh in southeast asia yah
okay
yah
uh um outside of the hotel are there any other uh restaurants that i can choose from
they outside yah
outside your hotel uh there is a chinese restaurant uh across the road
then if you love indian food indian curry that you have to walk across to that train station that i'm talking about
the whole street there call serangoon road in fact is um a place whereby eh uh most of the indian food are sold there
uh you can of course take a walk there if you want to
you can see on this part of the area you'll find that um serangoon road
can you see that serangoon road
i'm not sure uh what to look for
no do you can you see the ne seven
yah i am seeing the map and uh yap serangoon
yah ye the ne seven in the serangoon road uh which is here
yah this is the whole street whereby a lots of indian food are sold here
lots of um indian related accessories and also uh indian goods which you uh will like to take a look at or to purchase them
and this is a very good street for uh tourist as well
okay
alright
okay that sounds interesting
uh yah
yah
so instead of going very far away staying in a nice hotel in the city if you stay nearby here quite near to the station and also near to little india where you can shop around to found out more about the indian community while living here
and not only that uh goods which are related to the indian community may have not come from indian itself it may uh came from europe
people who are staying in europe but they are indians
they pre uh they made those things and then they bring back to singapore and sell it here
okay interesting story mathew
yah
um i think i would love to uh stay there in fragrance
okay
yah i mean i love indian culture so i definitely uh would enjoy my stay there
so okay so hotel wise i guess this would be your choice right
yah
um from here then we will go to your attraction right
okay cool
uh right
so i guess uh you had heard about uh uh you said just now you were saying that you love uh theme parks right
yah
uh so uh the next one that i'm gonna tell you is about a theme park which is uh also accessible uh by train to this theme park
so this theme park the name of the theme park in fact is called the universal studio
oh you got universal studios there huh
yes
we have universal studio here in singapore
so um just give me a minute and let's pull out the universal studio for you huh
okay
so this will not be a package deal right
eh no usually it will not be a package deal because you see the thing is you have a limited of time in singapore you only have two days
and with these two days you try to see uh what is uh most interesting here
then to hop a few places whereby you kinda physically enjoy it
so
okay just making sure
i really don't want to have any uh package deals huh
uh yah
yah i see uh i don't think you will like to go to a place whereby you know uh when you reach there okay uh five minutes we have to go
that goes to another place
then you know it's like you don't visit the place at all
you just go there and uh see the entrance and then they leave
yap
yah true
i alright
so basically make full use of your time when you are here in singapore
if you uh in the later part if you have more budget and you wanted to stay for a longer time then that you can probably consider at the later part
alright
so probably if want to catch the latest in singapore the universal studio is one of the place that you should not miss uh if you like theme park
so here we are then you can see this is universal studio
and we have the transformer here the transformer ride
and transformer ride in fact is uh quite new
and uh this uh transformer has been showing in uh new york
uh but of course uh singapore is having one of the best of all
so i'm gonna show you right now um how to get there what are the ticket price which is involve yah
okay
right
now how to get there uh to universal studio in fact from your hotel if you were to take um the northeast train which we call it the ne seven from your hotel you remember right
the ne seven
yah
now the ne seven will take you all the way up to uh the station here call the harbourfront
harbourfront
okay if you were to see below uh down here you can see northeast line mrt rail okay
now the northeast line mrt rail okay if you look carefully you will find that this is uh little india right
okay
can you see from the screen
yah i'm still following
okay
so from you screen yeh the ne seven is the nearest train that you can pick it up
so it's lit eh the station in fact is known as little india
you take the train all the way from little india to the harbourfront which is here
okay
the number six right
okay
so that will be the ending part of the northeast line
and from the northeast line the same building itself there is a sentosa express which is there
but the distance from your little india to harbourfront approximately fare for the train ride per person is about three dollars
three dollars
and how many uh minutes is the trip
yah three dollars
then approximately about ten minutes from here huh
okay
so from this uh station when you get out from this station in fact it's also known as harbourfront
but the building name is known as vivocity
vivocity
alright
revo
uh v i v o
v i v o okay
vivo okay
yes
yah from the vivo station there is a sentosa express which eh will lead you into universal studio
is that the train
yes there is an express train we call it the sentosa express
if you will take a look here on your map on your screen again you can see sentosa express
can you see the screen right now
well eh i think you closed it that's all
still clicking
yah alright
so from your screen you can see sentosa express which is located in vivocity level three
you can pick up the sentosa express to this station called waterfront station
this sentosa express only goes into sentosa island and with uh universal studio is located inside this sentosa island
and it's run by the organisation called the resort world singapore
so resort world is also part of sentosa so you have to take that train to the uh universal studio and the station to alight is one station away only which is known as the waterfront station alright
but for this admission you will have to pay an admission fees of three dollars
three dollars for the admission
if you wanna save up some money again uh you can always do a morning exercise by taking a walk into the sentosa island which you have to pay an admission of one dollar
okay
okay
yah so there are
oh by the way mathew do i have to uh pay for the sentosa express
eh yes of course
uh you wil uh are you with me on the screen right now
can you see the sentosa express there
yah
now if you it states down there take sentosa express uh to uh located on level three vivocity lobby l and alight at waterfront and the flag fee of three dollars apply
ah okay alright
okay so
so that means that you have to uh um pay the admission fee uh at the uh train uh at the sentosa counter
alright so from little india to vivo uh mall that's three dollars right
so they will get correct
and then
no they yah approximately yes correct
and then from vivo to uh sentosa uh it's another three dollars so six dollars all in all
and then i would have to uh pay another three dollars for the entrance fee that is if i uh i mean that is if i wanted uh a quick ride right
yah
yes
correct
yes
yes correct
okay but if i just plan to a walk it's about a dollar okay
yes yap in total it's about yah
yah
yes correct
okay
yah
so uh that is possible if you choose either one of them you see
if you wanna take it uh take a ride in the comfort manner if you're walking all the way to get sweat in the early morning uh you wanna take a ride quickly to the universal studio you just pay the three dollars for the admission at this sentosa express
then of course that is a lot more convenient
well of course uh if you choose too um uh okay
if you choose um to take the pub direct public buses uh only applies for foreigners uh you can pick it up at bencoolen street or bencoolen's road which is quite near to your hotel
but you have to go to the correct hotel
so um you can see uh on your map right now uh under universal studio free shuttle service
that provided if you are staying uh nearby to that particular area
okay
yah
let me see from here
um that's by seeing the opportunity huh
okay now um from the bus schedule itself it is seems like you can only pick up uh this shuttle service at summer view hotel which is not far walking distant from your hotel
but there is a timing for you to catch if you want to uh have a pick up from there
okay and uh that bus goes straightly to uh the theme park
yes it go directly to the theme park
how much will cost me
okay let me see ah. alright the universal studio uh buses is actually free of charge
oh really huh
yah but you have to walk to that particular hotel
uh how many minutes uh do you think is the walk
it's approximately about ten minutes
if you were to see just now at the fragrance hotel and i show you the map again
okay now can you take a look at your map right
you'll find that the blue uh ho the blue icon which is there is your hotel
and summer view hotel is located at this end
here on this side
you have to walk cutting across um the street itself
then you will reach the summer view hotel and you have to pick up that the sentosa uh shuttle service which is free of charge from there to universal studio
okay
alright
alright
so is walking distance still but uh the option is yours
uh if you want to pick up the free shuttle service
now coming back um this is the main or way of transportation to that particular place right
okay
yah
and of course uh next thing is you'd like to know how much is the ticket for the universal studio right
well you mention three dollars so is there another different rate
no that no that is the transportation part that you need to pay for your transportation
oh you mention the before that i have to pay three dollars entrance fee right
yes the three dollars entrance fees applies to sentosa island
it doesn't apply to the admission to the attraction called universal studio
ah okay so pretty much i'm going to an island
yes correct
so going to uh
okay
so inside the island um the uh theme park is there
correct
okay so there's another entrance fee for that right
so correct
okay make sense
yah
so right now um i'm trying to uh put up the uh i trying to pull up the season chart
and you can see uh in a while on your screen uh there is a universal studio calendar
the minute when you see the calendar just uh let me know
so that i can go through with you on the calendar to let you see and how the price are actually work out for the universal studio
okay
okay
well quite expensive
i have to uh say this to you uh it's quite expensive
well it's uh
um what does it cover
okay now uh you are with the universal studio calendar right now
yah
alright now you can see that the
and yah meaning if uh i'm checking the calendar and it looks like uh i'll be there on april seventh and april eighth which is unfortunately are peak dates
yah on the april seventh now uh on the seventh if you are trying to go for universal studio uh you will really have to go pretty way in advance
that means is probably you have to try your luck now in order to make sure that you can get the ticket online
now uh the ticket price if you are really going on the seventh which i would advise not to but you choose to go on the seventh then you have to prepare
uh there will be a huge crowd in the universal studio
and if you are going on the eighth then that will be slightly better
but then you still face the crowd
uh but of course there is uh the secondary way out for this uh for the peak season we call it the peak because it's during the weekend
the adult fee is seventy four dollars and of course uh you are not senior citizen right
yah
okay right
now the express pass at fifty dollars that means that um inside the universal studio there are two kind of queues which are there
one which you are paying for a normal ticket you get into joining the huge long queue
uh the other express ticket allows you to join the shorter queue
that means that if you purchase an additional fifty dollars uh on top of the ticket you have a chance to join at the shorter queue
so that it cuts uh waiting time uh for the attraction
so that was the meaning of having the express pass
okay
right so if you were to consider of getting the express pass that would be about hundred and twenty four dollars per person right
so you have about two hundred and forty eight two hundred forty eight
plus your hotel will be another uh two hundred dollars so about four hundred dollars now
so inside universal studio uh what is being included
now in fact universal studio is a theme park and the minute when you purchase this ticket uh there ar no limits as on how many times you can go on that particular ride or attraction
okay sounds good
so that means that that means that if you like the ride so much you can go the second time even the third time uh as long as you enjoy it yah
and if i pay the uh express uh fee that means i get to uh ride as soon as i can right
yah
correct
uh as soon as the shorter queue uh available yah
okay
okay
so you can see um
as long as my stomach can handle huh
okay
okay
now uh let me just go back to the other one which is there
now coming i'm gonna show you the map inside the universal studio
now if you are if your screen is ready just let me know so that i can go through it with you one-by-one like what is eh there to offer inside the universal studio
okay
is your screen up there
yap
alright now if you will take a look carefully onto the lost world which my uh castle is there
now this lost world come uh with uh theme park uh rides which is required uh the water ride
this is the only water rides available here
uh the lost world if you ha have you watch the movie called jurassic park
yes i'm familiar with the movie
okay right
so it's actually a mock-up of the jurassic park and in a small scale sky
and uh do you ride
so there are real dinosaurs there
uh no they are fake dinosaurs
okay just wanna be sure
uh yah
no of course and then we also do have the uh if you have watched the movie called the water world
now that they are there inside this uh small green portion of uh fireworks here
uh that is the show which they are showing live
uh part of the show um not the full complete show of the water world
oh cool
uh with uh live exhibit fireworks and um uh interactive uh performance uh right in front of the guest
so will i able to um meet kevin costner
not the original star ah
not the original one
okay
right
then of course if you like the uh water rides and there is a water ride you call the repeat adventure which is quite nice and interesting
it's something like a hydraulic wave that would takes you into the canal which will uh let you have a very nice enjoyable water rides yah
so i'll get wet with that ride right
yes of course
so in case if you plan to take this ride then you probably have to bring uh one more extra clothing with you
okay alright
right
so this is uh the lost world
then inside there inside the universal studio we also have the um ancient egypt
if you have catch the movie called the revenge of the mummy
uh this is actually a part of the mock-up for the uh roller coaster ride
uh you know the um the mine coaster
uh that is the ride which is available inside this ancient egypt
of course uh a few things here as well inside the universal studio food and drinks are not allowed to be in by guest
okay
yah you have to purchase their food and drinks inside the universal studio
so food wise is located near to the jurassic park where the lost world is
and it's also located near to ancient egypt
so those uh you can get ala carte food um indian food if you want to
so it's available there
so food court is located at uh the jurassic park area
so this is
but i'm sure it's more expensive than uh your normal
well at food court usually the food which is serve there approximately huh i will say approximately you have uh one meal it will cost you approximately around about twelve dollars singapore dollar
but if i'm gonna take it on uh outside of uh universal uh studio how much do you think is the uh price difference
eh well uh you can't compare the street food and the food court inside universal studio
because the universal studio have um lots of facilities inside the food court
okay
like for example clean environment air conditioner yap
you know um you have uh facilities for young children huh
all those things are there
so of course uh to have that kind of facilities uh the price for the food of course is a little bit different huh
but if you take food court outside there probably it will cost five dollars
at the most fifty per cent more compare to
okay alright
yah
but you can't get any food other than the food court inside there
so you have to take the food there
alright
right
now uh then the other one is the sci-fi centre
sci-fi centre in fact uh has as you can there are so many lines which are there the blue and the red
now those are roller coaster track which is uh for the uh battlestar galatica
uh this is the world fastest and tallest roller coaster ever constructed
oh really huh
i would say fastest means it complete the cycle within one minute
oh really huh
yes
so uh that is a little bit different and in at the sci-fi centre we also do have uh the latest attraction now which you see just now the transformer
it's actually a three d i would say three d four d movie rides inside there right
quite interesting
do i have uh pay extra to uh watch that movie
no nothing is required to be paid inside there except your food and the purchases done by you for your uh what you call souvenirs huh
okay
so uh all the things are
the ticket price inclusive of all the rides unlimited rides inside there
okay
yah
so the other part is where you can see the new york
and new york if you have you do you know the guy which is uh producing a lots of uh sci-fic uh movies
steven spielberg
yah of course
yah of course huh
he is very popular in his scientific movie
now in fact for this person to produce a movie he in fact don't create the movie outside uh not only outside uh the premises but he created the movie inside a theatre itself
so you can just imagine there you know you have um a strong tornado coming in
you know he can create a tornado inside the theatre itself to film it
so you see how wonderful he is uh and he is been conducted inside the theatre itself
so it's a nice place to see and experience
then um the other part is um this part here we call it the hollywood
that is where the dance are there
and of course lots of retailer shops are here to sell souvenirs of universal studio singapore
and the other one which is madagascar
if you have watch the cartoon movie called madagascar that uh is the place whereby they will be performing at the same time
there are some other rides which are also available there
then the last part will be the uh far far away which is if you have watch th cartoon movie called the shrek movie this is one part the movie which they make into three d's and it's a ride inside the um uh four d theatre itself
okay
okay
so this is the whole thing of the uh universal studio
and if you were to ask me how much time it's gonna take uh let me say that eh since you are going on the uh weekend you uh expected to have uh approximately between nine thirty to five thirty in the whole day
i would say
to occupy your time yah
okay
well what's their operating hours by the way
the operating hour for universal studio for the rides is from uh nine thirty the gates will open it will start from that time
eh the last ride will be at seven that's it
eh seven will be the closing time for the rides
and after seven uh restaurants and retailer shops are still open
uh but no more rides are there
okay
um but how about the uh shuttle is it uh available twenty four hours
yah
no as you can see uh just now the shuttle service provided from the free shuttle service uh usually has a timing
so you have to catch the timing for the shuttle buses
the last bus left from uh resort world universal studio will be at ten p.m. uh sorry uh yah uh ten sorry
uh ten thirty p.m. yah
okay sound reasonable
yah
yah
so if yo if you wanna spend time walking along the retailer shops you can also that too
okay
so this is the time table for the resort world
if you want catch the free shuttle bus i would say
okay
alright
or otherwise the normal train systems uh they start operating from morning as early as five thirty and will the finish the last train at twelve midnight
okay i'm interested
uh i may have to uh do that
um obviously i have to uh do this in the day
uh what are the other things i can do the next day though
well i plan to do some shopping so uh maybe you can appoint me out uh to the nearest malls
right
yah
right
okay now uh so this will be occupying for your full day
so you of course uh you can have dinner there and uh of course you also can do sentosa if you want to for the song of the sea right
yah
what's the song in the sea
a song in the sea in fact is uh laser show inside sentosa
uh but that again you have to take the train inwards into the beach station
uh let me just pull up the sentosa for you
so that it keep you occupy for the uh full day
okay right
if you uh to see on your screen right now you'll be able to see the song of the sea
yes
okay
yah so the song of the sea is located inside the sentosa
so if you were to take the train again it's free because you had already get paid for the admission into the sentosa island
so that train ride from the waterfront to the beach station where the song of the sea is located is free
so you can take a ride there but you have to uh purchase a separate ticket for the song of the sea which is ten dollars per person
okay
that can actually uh makes you eh that can actually uh last your night throughout the whole programme
from the morning all the way until at end of the day okay
okay
right
so the same day again the minute when you are done you can take the sentosa express from the beach station all the way back to the vivocity
or you can also take it back to the resort world where you can take the uh free shuttle buses for the tourist back to your hotel right
alright
okay so that is uh for the first day yah
yap that is for the first day i would say so
and as i've said for the second day um
okay
you like some shopping
yah probably i'll do some shopping uh you know you already uh give me a handful there
so i uh may want to uh relax on the second day and you know probably uh buy some uh clothing and some souvenirs and that's pretty much it
electronics
yeh electronics i would love to uh well first from uh what i've heard uh singapore uh is selling you know cheap electronics in the world so
uh yes
in fact um most of the peo uh most of the visitor come to singapore they usually like to shop for electronics
right and now um for sim lim square it will be the nearest electronic mall to uh from your hotel right
from your hotel
so um right
now it's walking distance uh probably it takes about five to ten minutes towards sim lim square
and uh i just show you uh where it's located so that you can easily get around
now can you see
okay
okay
um hm okay
now you can see from uh the station here
eh can you see smrt link
hm no
uh no not yet is it
the screen is not coming up yet isn't it
smrt link
can you see
yah then you can see that there is um free shuttle service from little india shoppers right
there's free shuttle service
so if you want to take a walk you can take a walk
if you want to take the free shuttles you can take the free shuttles as well
but it's uh not very far away from your hotel so i would guess probably by walking would be uh good for you and save some time
only about five to ten minutes walk at the most
yes
right
alright
now for this sim lim square basically is a six level of electronic mall
they sell uh electronics like uh computer notebooks uh printers uh uh pda's tablets anything you need with deal with electronics there is available inside this mall
and of course um this mall is also very popular uh for uh the vi uh for the tourist
and if you were to purchase any of the item here in singapore if you were to purchase uh not only electronic but some clothing as well in singapore
any purchases that you make in singapore above hundred dollars on a single receipt and you would enjoy a tax refund of seven per cent uh if you are travelling out of singapore by through changi this changi international airport
so if you are travelling out from singapore through uh coach then you will not be entitle for the seven per cent rebates
so if you were to buy any electronics or clothing you please ask them to give you a tax refund form
a tax refund form will be given to you by the retailer if you purchase a hundred dollars and above
right
uh i'm sorry uh you mention that it has to be uh from where
in a chinese airport you mention that
changi international airport
ah okay so i
there's only one international airport here
so uh if you were to travel through singapore by air and going out uh through changi airport then you will get the tax refund
ah okay
then you enjoy the tax rebate by the yah
alright
seven per cent alright
yah seven per cent
alright it's cool
in fact if you buy a notebook of uh one thousand dollars you'll probably get uh seven per cent back from there
then
and is that available for tourist only
yes it's only available for tourist
not meant for the local alright
okay
alright so these are there's a list of stalls which are there if you want to take a look
you can see that um this is actually a floor plan map of how uh level one is look like
you can see that uh there are so many shops are there even if you were to stand about two or three hours there i think still not sufficient
it's a and next to the sim lim square we also do have the clothing mall where you can pick-up some shoes or clothes pants huh
uh your girlfriend which is going with you uh she can spend some time there while you spend some time in the electronic mall
then you meet in-between
yah
okay
yah
what's the name of that mall
is it also a part of sim lim okay
is it also a part of sim lim okay
uh sim lim square
uh next to sim lim square we have the um albert complex uh
albert complex
yah
uh let me just yah albert complex yeh you can see uh if you were to see from your screen right now you'll find that uh this is albert complex
and in fact uh sim lim square is next to albert complex
okay
yah
alright
so um
just a minute i'll get okay i'm enlarging the map here
uh you can see that sim lim square is here
alright
now can you see from here
from your map
yah
do you see a full map here
yah
now selegie fragrance hotel is here
so if you were to walk across follow the main road and just walk to uh sim lim square the electronic mall
and albert complex is next to it
so again at this area eh not only that you can do your shopping but you can also visit some tourist attraction at located at this area where we have the kwam im temple which is one of the popular
and we also have the hindu temple which is around at the other corner uh within your walking distance
so you need not have to travel to much on transportation in fact by foot is possible also
okay
right
so i guess uh this can fully also occupy your second day
uh but if you really want to go to some very unique uh having some meaning uh about singapore the merlion park is one of them that you should not miss
but uh um of course the merlion you have to take the train system down to the merlion park right
okay
yah
alright then as you've said i think uh you know just buy our shopping
uh that will pretty much uh cover the uh whole second day
so if i still have a time i may have to uh have a look at that uh i can check that on the website right
yah
