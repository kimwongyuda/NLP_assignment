hi good morning
uh good afternoon
this is uh tour guide one
lynnette here
yah
hi lynnette this is participant number eleven
and can i have your name please
yah
yah this is participant number eleven
okay and how can i help you
yah i'm planning to have um to go around asia and singapore is at the top of my list
and what attractions can i go in singapore
okay
uh which part of the year are you planning to come
um maybe this um last week of may
this year
okay
and how many people are coming with you
um couple of my friends
okay and ha uh okay what do you and your friends like to do
um for me i like to know about the culture history and of course historical places in singapore
uh sorry i didn't get you
the last one what did you say
um it's the historical places in singapore
i'm sorry for that
okay
so uh you like to see culture history
yah
and uh places
pla yes that's right
places
yes
okay
okay so uh for the culture-wise
singapore has a few culture
so we have like the chinese culture
yah
yes
hm lynnette i have a question because um i was kinda yes
yes lynnette
uh yes
for the culture side we have uh the chinese culture
we have the malay
arab culture
we also have the indian culture
so which one should i introduce you first
i think the chinese culture
the chinese culture
yes
okay
i would like to introduce you to the chinatown uh of singapore
yes
yes
okay i'm just going to show you this is just one picture of chinatown
yes and are there a lot of souvenirs in chinatown in singapore
ah yes
there are souvenirs available but they will be all uh chinese related kind of souvenir
so this is just one street scene in chinatown
alright
yes
i'm going to show you
yah this is just a street scene in chinatown
and then when the people in the past come to singapore
uh they all live near the singapore river
so chinatown is actually just next to the singapore river
their houses you could see are more elaborate
they have uh these carvings
alright some of these houses have carvings outside their houses
uh and it will be a little bit different from the other culture
hm yes
uh so
alright
the houses in the chinatown how what year they were built
okay
more most of these chinatown houses i would say they are in the range of about a hundred twenty years now
like again wow
i see
they were yah they we're built in the early nineteen hundreds
so the different and the chinese are also divided into various dialect speaking
hm would it be the mandarin one or hm the two what's this
the chinese dialects
okay
dialects are spoken languages
i see
yah
uh languages will be both spoken and written
so uh dialect meaning it's just spoken language
so this people they came from china and they live in uh various so-called uh provinces in china
and they speak different dialect
so when they come here uh not every one of them would speak mandarin
yah
so they will still be just speaking in their uh dialects
i see
i got it
alright
so when they came here they still live in different street uh in singapore
hm i have a question
is chinatown the one of the most visited places
uh i would say it's a popular spot for tourist to visit
if you want to learn to see the chinese um houses
yes
uh where do the chinese uh used to live uh in the past
and there are some pictures on your right-hand side
these are just some old photograph of uh chinatown
yes
yes is that hm a horse or what's this
the one in the street
okay this is actually uh a bullock cart
okay this is actually uh a bullock cart
yah in the past they don't have uh motor vehicles
motor vehicles came later part of the years
so they started using bullock cart to transport their goods
uh and uh yah mainly for transportation of goods
oh yes
for people they would be using the trishaws
it's a three-wheel vehicle
uh yes
uh so this is the scene uh what you can see in chinatown
and you also mentioned about history right
yes
okay
uh do you want me to introduce you to uh a museum in chinatown
yah
okay
that would be fine
okay
we have a museum in chinatown and uh this museum is called the chinatown heritage centre
yes are there is there a show in that heritage centre
uh there is no show but there are some uh tv programmes that you can stop to see
it is not a very big museum
hm so
uh so uh i see
so there are no cultural shows
okay so uh no culture show for this uh museum
it is housed inside a shop house
okay
i see
okay so you can see the layout of the first level
yes
okay
and the second level
yup
okay and the third level
so it's a three level building
alright
yes
there are no escalators
there's only a lift but the lift is quite small
that's fine
yah
so you are young right
so you should be okay
yup
so it's accessible by the mrt
uh huh
okay
so these are just some of the things that you'll be looking at inside the uh uh inside the uh museum
so um yes lynnette um i have a question
okay
yes
um because uh singapore is neighbouring malaysia indonesia thailand
hm i want to know who are the ancestors of singaporeans
uh ancestors of singaporeans
yes
okay
uh in the beginning uh there were actually some native singaporeans who live here
yes
alright
uh there were about thousand of them
and uh we do have uh back in the past we were actually part of the mahajapit forces based in indonesia
uh mahajan people
yes
yes
and uh well things were going fine
we had kings to rule us
they were about five of them
kings in singapore
uh kings yes
there were kings in singapore
alright
uh the first king of singapore is called sang nila utama
sang nila utama
yes
and he uh named us singapura from temasek he renamed us as singapura uh and that's how singapore gets its name
alright
now the last king of singapore because he was pursued by his uh enemies
and he went over to melaka setup and other kingdom there
so we do not have any more kings here
alright
and so it was pretty quiet out here again until the year of eighteen nineteen when raffles came to singapore
so when he came here we have approximately about a thousand people living here
yes who is raffles
it's the uh raffles is from uh britain
uh brittanian uh so
yes he's a european
uh yah
so he came here because he was uh working for the british east india company
uh so yes
alright
now when he came here later on he decided to make singapore into a free port
so from then on many people from all over the world started to come here
uh for trades and business
yes for trade and business
and to seek for employment as well
yup
uh so there are people from all over the world coming here
yes
for example we have people from the nearby malay archipelago area
what's malay archipelago area
what's hm what country is that
okay
so the malay archipelago we will be talking about the indonesian uh islands
uh indonesia
i see
alright
we are talking about uh malaysia
yah
yes
malaya at that time
uh we are uh so basically nearby to singapore we call this the malay archipelago
malay archipela
yah
and we also have people coming from china
alright
yes
we also have people coming from europe
yes
and we have people coming from the arab countries
yes so
so the main group of people would be from these countries
yah
uh so it's a mix of races
uh yes
um yes
so singapore is now multi-racial
and
because of our history
yes
i'll look at that
yes
hm i saw here that you have a relic temple
okay
uh buddha relic temple
yes
okay
that is in chinatown
uh that's in chinatown
yes
so there are a lot of things to do in chinatown
uh the buddha relic temple is just located in chinatown
and you could do those temple when you are going down to chinatown
alright
so i'm going to show you again the image of the buddha relic temple
yes
yes so uh lynnette i have a question
so we can walk through the through chinatown and through this um other attractions from another to from other attraction to for example chinatown and it's neighbouring attractions
uh yes
this is all uh built uh just in chinatown itself
chinatown has a few lanes
alright it's not just one street
so it's actually consists of quite a number of lanes
uh and one of the attractions uh you are thinking of visiting is this buddha relic temple
yah that's nice
you can walk inside but there is a dress code
uh dress code
so what's the dress code
uh dress code you will have to be appropriately dressed
for example uh no like shorts
cute like i mean sorry uh cargo pants uh just will be fine
uh singlet of course is not appropriate uh dress code for uh visiting any places of worship here
yes
hm are there a lot of people worship in that temple
oh yes
there are local people who goes in uh to do their prayers uh during the opening hours of the temple
uh so uh you will see yes worshippers going in to worship
but otherwise uh most of the time in uh chinese temples uh it will be more crowded when uh like on special days
uh the first day and the fifteenth day of the chinese calendar which is different from the western calendar
yes
yes
okay
and of course during the buddha
uh the buddha uh birthday
yes you will find that uh more people would be worshiping uh otherwise it's uh well that is it's not that crowded to visit the buddha relic temple
yes
hm so it's quite a walk when i go around chinatown hm. would can i
yes
quite a walk
uh if you are thinking of taking the mrt it is just about three lanes away
yah
yah but it's okay
okay then
yes
yes
so uh i think uh it again depends on whether you want to visit um uh it's it all depends whether you want to visit the chinatown heritage centre
if you were planning to do that then you have to allocate about one hour in the at chinatown heritage centre or minimum forty minutes i would say
uh so forty minutes
the buddha relic temple approximately uh twenty minutes
yah
yes
uh walk through some of the lanes probably would take you about uh one and a half hours
yes
so well you can spend easily half a day just doing uh these few places
so i can go around for half a day and visit all the places in chinatown
yes
yes that's right
hm beca
so do you want to eat some uh chinese food in chinatown
yes
okay
do you want to go to a restaurant
yup
or you want to do just uh non-air conditioned food places
hm how about the restaurant
sorry
restaurants
how yes
how about in a restaurant
okay
uh do you know this food called chinese dim sum
hm yes
okay
chinese dim sum
yah
so these are just some uh like uh small little food and they normally steam them in a bamboo container
otherwise you there are also some dishes that is fried
uh so that would be something that you can get uh in chinatown
alright chinese dim sum in
yes
chinatown huh
and yes
yes and also uh lynnette
hm what about the night life in singapore

s is it near to the first the previous one
do you the one in chinatown
is this club near to that place or how can i get there from this club
okay
alright
now you will have to uh take a mrt
yah
alright
and the closest mrt stop for you would be at this station called the uh tiong bahru mrt train station
tiong bahru mrt station
yes
uh this is on the west line
so how many minutes would it take from
okay
assuming that your hotel is located somewhere in uh orchard road
uh it will take you approximately uh it's actually quite nearby but because there's no direct line from orchard road so you will have to uh plan about uh twenty minutes
twenty minutes
yes
because you will have to change line
okay
okay
so another uh so the dress code do you need to tell to uh do you need me to tell you about dress code
yes
sure
okay it will be party wear
i mean uh night uh clubs outfit
i'm sorry
uh yes
okay
yah
okay
so you understand what i mean right
yes
okay another yes
uh so so the clubs in singapore also have dress codes
uh yes
okay another uh club that i would like to introduce you would be this one that i'm going to show you now
what is the name of this club
it's s
this is quite a few clubs in there
it's called saint james power station
so in one building there's hm a few clubs or several clubs in that building
yah
yes
there are few uh different kind of clubs that you can see uh in this power station
it's not used as a power station anymore
there are clubs in there
so you have different themes in this uh park so you can hop from one to the other
so kind of bar hopping from one to another
yah
so uh yah what i mean is you can go if you don't like this club you can go till then move on to the next one and the next one
alright
so this is in saint james power station
to the another
yah
and um lynnette
yes
hm i would also like to ask you about the gadgets in singapore
because i
gadget
yes
uh what sort of gadgets are you talking about
hm like places where i can buy gadgets
uh computers laptop so on and so forth
yes or like yes
okay
now this is one uh uh shopping complex uh that you can uh visit
it's called funan digilife or funan it mall
okay this is the funan it mall
an it mall
yes
the location is just near the it's about seven minutes walk from city hall mrt
so from my hotel from there i'm gonna have a little ride at mrt
yes
it's quite convenient to ride the mrt uh in singapore
okay
yes
so uh like i mentioned this is near the city hall mrt train station
yes
oh and yes we haven't uh introduced you to any hotel yet
uh i'm sorry
okay
so the it mall there are a number about five levels of shopping
and these uh every other shop sells it related products
for example from cameras right up to laptops to accessories uh can be found in this mall
yes
yes
that's right
it's a five level building
yes
uh yeah
and it's all uh it related products in there
so you can spend up to you you know the how many hours you take to find uh the product that you wanted to buy
oh uh yes
yes
yup
hm so now lynnette hm how about the accommodation or the hotel that i will
okay
for the hotels in singapore they have various uh ranges uh in terms of price range
im taking
yes
so we have uh let's say the three to the four star hotels uh ranges from about hundred and fifty uh onwards to about two hundred
uh and of course we have the three hundred to four hundred range and four hundred and above
or even the uh what you call the value hotels the budget hotels
um budget hotels because i only have one thousand singapore dollars and there are three of us
okay
alright
so okay i can give you these budget hotels
okay
these are some of the budget hotels that we have in singapore
okay uh one of the companies that runs these ho budget hotels is called uh hotel eighty one
hotel eight
okay
yes
and they are pretty small hotel
i mean the rooms are pretty small
um okay
so this is nearer for you dickson or chinatown
yes
okay
there's also this budget hotel in chinatown
hm is it a part of chinatown or i will ride again
uh no it's actually right in the heart of chinatown
but just bear in mind the rooms are not that big
the mrt
okay
yah
so these are
well that's fine
yah
so price range would be in the region of about a hundred and fifty
price range
okay
so these are just some pictures of the
uh okay
hotels
uh budget hotels
yah
so there are few uh budget hotels located in orchard road
even this one at beach road
so the hotels in singapore are located uh most of the hotels in singapore are located in arch it's is it archer road am i right
yes
orchard o r c h a orchard road yah
orchard i'm sorry orchard road
okay thank you
so quite a lot of hotels are located along orchard road
but of course if you choose to live further away there are also hotels available
but because you are going to spend just a few days here so i would recommend that you stay closer um around chinatown
that's one at beach road
you can stay in this uh beach road area as well
yes
okay
and this one it's also okay
hotel grand chancellor
yes hotel grand chancellor
okay
but if you want to stay in orchard road there are also other hotels out there as well
alright
yup
okay
would you want to consider backpackers
hm i heard backpackers a lot so it's kind uh hm familiar hotel so i like that one
you like uh backpackers hotel
yes
okay we have backpackers hotel
just now we mentioned about you like history right
yes
okay
can i recommend you one hotel budget hotel
uh that is located just right in the heart of another cultural area
oh that's great
and this one yah this is called sleepy sam
hm so the budget hotel is near the cultural areas of singapore or uh another cultural area
uh just now i mentioned about the budget hotel like hotel eighty one
that's one in chinatown
yes
yes
okay
okay
so you also mentioned about you like history
so we already talked about chinatown
so that is the chinese area
yup
sleepy sam
yah
so now i can recommend you an uh this is actually a backpackers hotel and it's located in another cultural place called kampong glam
kampong glam
what's kampong glam
okay
kampong is a malay word it means village and glam is actually named after glam trees
so there used to be a lot of glam trees that's found in this kampong but no longer now
we only have a few of this glum tree that's left
uh this is the location of the uh sleepy sam
yes
alright
and the it's uh also near the mrt called bugis
okay
so it will be a different kind of location from the chinatown budget hotel
this one would be uh in the so-called malay and the arab quarters
yup
and that's great
hm so um lynnette hm i would like to ask if um is there hm for the fee of a tour guide
yes
okay
uh it all depends
you can go to the guides online and you can call up the guides if you want to do a half-day tour
uh the charges depends alright on the guide
uh normally uh the guides will charge like let's say uh in the range of from for one person two person it doesn't matter
okay from the range of let's say because this would be like a private basis or small group of people
um and if you are just talking about uh walking tours uh that they will charge probably in the range of twenty five dollars per hour
yup
okay
yes
twenty five dollars
yes approximately
hm so that's hm for example there are three of us
yes
so twenty five dollars per hour am i right
yes
so that would be about uh no i mean like i said it doesn't matter how many of you
uh okay
uh it's so yah so approximately about twenty five dollars per hour
yah
okay otherwise you can walk around on your own uh if you choose to stay in sleepy sam
uh you are in the malay quarters so this is kampong glam and uh kampong glam as you can see from the left-hand side of
yes
as yup
the uh picture
there is a picture of a mosque and this is called the sultan mosque
this picture will show you a street scene in uh kampong glam
uh over here of course it's used to be the malay quarters
you will find malay cuisine out here
yes
yes
yes
malay cuisines uh
uh yes
so malay cuisines are a little bit more spicy food compared to the chinese food
and do you want me to introduce you to some malay food
yes of course
alright
the malay food uh compared to the chinese will be more spicy
so we have like simple dishes called mee siam
mee siam
mee siam is actually the small thin white noodles
yes
um and we put in a sour kind of a sauce uh together with this with a hard-boiled egg
um so this is uh um mee siam
alright
hm is it really hot
uh a little bit spicy. it's a little bit sour and spicy
uh a little bit spicy. it's a little bit sour and spicy
uh this is um mee siam
alright
otherwise we do have also uh another malay food called uh mee soto
that's fine
yes
okay mee siam mee soto it's a noodles with cooked in um chicken straps
yes
with a little bit of soup
um not that spicy just a tinge of spice
uh okay so this will be malay food
alright
yes
because i like spicy foods and i believe i will like it
okay sure
and there are also some uh restaurants in uh kampong glam
alright
uh and they serve uh rice with dishes
we call it the nasi padang
nasi padang
yes
nasi is um a malay word it means rice
okay and you get to choose your dishes in uh to go with your rice
yup so that's there is a ri that's a rice in a bowl or something like that
yes you get your rice and uh you have this uh dishes like for example fried chicken uh vegetables but of course they are spicy
usually they are spicy
um and uh so that is uh malay food yah in uh in kampong glam nasi padang
yah
yes
okay
and also you can have another malay food called uh satay
uh satay what's that food
okay this food is um uh marinated meat
you can have uh chicken uh mutton uh marinated and they pierce through a skewer and it's barbecued over charcoal and you dip them with a peanut sauce uh spicy peanut sauce
so that is another very typical uh malay food in uh where you can uh find in uh singapore
alright so this is malay food
uh the other and you can also even get indonesian cuisine uh over in kampong glam
yes
yes
yup
yes
okay
so you have this like a smashed uh chicken with rice
we call it ayam penyet
uh that is
ayam pen
yes that you can also find in kampong glam as well as in other parts of singapore
hm how about other cuisines that you have in singapore or in that place
uh in kampong glam itself
yes in glam yes
okay
there are uh mid-eastern uh cuisine that you can find in uh kampong glam
egyptian
hm egyptian
turkish
uh even mediterranean and there's even a swedish cafe uh that's found in kampong glam
it's hm so it's a mix of different countries or restaurants from different countries
uh but in kampong glam mainly it will be malay cuisine and indonesian i would say
yah
uh malay cuisine
uh okay
but like i said there are some arabic uh egyptian and turkish uh restaurants that's found in kampong glam itself
in the
yup
would you want to pay a visit to the mosque
yes of course
okay
so again yes you ca you are permitted to enter the sultan mosque in kampong glam
yes
and lynnette i have a question
yes
um are there people still worship in that mosque
uh yes
it is a living mosque so yes people do visit the mosque to pray
uh the mosque will be crowded in the afternoon uh on friday
on friday
yes
uh on other days uh that would be fine
but on friday uh they would not want to admit any uh visitors uh because they are going to have their prayers the congregational prayers on friday
alright
so you are coming on the fourteenth it's fine
fourteenth of may is actually monday
okay
hm are they all hm still i'm sorry
are there dress codes implemented in that mosque
uh yes
uh all the places of worship uh would have a dress code
so again um uh pants must be below the knee
yup
uh shorts or t-shirts uh with the shoulders covered
yes
uh otherwise if you are not so uh properly dressed uh the uh sultan mosque will provide a cloth uh for people to wear tourists to put over their clothes uh if they are not properly uh covered up
so we will pay for that
uh there is no admission to visit the uh sultan mosque
for that clothes
okay
uh but if you are non-muslim uh then we would not encourage you or we would uh ask you to refrain from getting into the prayer hall
okay
got it
okay
so that is uh the other second culture that we're talking about uh in singapore
yah
yes
hm what's the third one
okay we have another culture called the indians
alright
so traditionally uh these ethnic areas are where people used to live in the past
the various ethnic area
uh so okay
so this little india again it is accessible by the subway
so it's a place little india am i right
yes
little india in singapore
okay
i'm gonna show you some of the images here
okay
yes
i think it's not
hm is there uh yah
yah okay
this is uh one of the street scene in uh little india
hm so these houses hm what year they were built
uh which period of time they are built
in these houses
like um this one in the street
uh the year that they were built is it
yes
okay
now little india uh would be in the range of about a hundred years old because they uh came a bit later after the chinese quarters
yes
it's member uh when everybody came here they live in chinatown area
and it was very crowded so people started moving away
so they would be in the range of about a hundred years uh for little india
and um what do you call hm this transportation that uh these bikes
okay these uh vehicles we call them the trishaws
they are three-wheeled vehicles
tricycle
you don't see uh them plying um the other parts of the street uh other parts of singapore because they have designated uh trishaws stations that these trishaws can park
so it's not going to be very easy for you to flag a taxi uh for example on an um on other roads in singapore
s okay
would you be interested to get on one
uh yes
i like to
these are just used for sightseeing purposes
uh like i mentioned the trishaw men can only ride on designated uh roads in singapore
so you cannot tell him uh i want to uh go to changi airport then that's not possible
so the
alright
yes
yah
so designated area around the chinatown or the um uh at
uh little india
yah little in yah i'm sorry
uh little india area um as well as around the padang area that's about it for the trishaw ride
so these were now used for sightseeing uh purposes
uh so
and you have to get to the trishaw station uh to get on to these trishaws
okay
hm as and they also have a station
that's great
yes
uh the station uh is um located near bugis uh and you can see the trishaw there
okay that's great
so and this house is they were around hundred years ago so this house is some kind of history for this place
this is it's little india
yes
yes
yes so uh i have introduced you to you three of our main cultures uh that we have here
alright
uh okay
and thanks a lot and thank you for your help
much appreciated
we do have actually one more culture
uh i'm sorry for that
okay
yah we do have one more culture
uh yes
and that is located in the eastern part of singapore
we call them the peranakans
one last culture
okay
okay let me see that one
okay
are these um for example this little india the chinatown hm is it nearby to one another
or rather
uh yah
nearby to one another
yes
yes they are quite near to one another
uh in the sense that uh it's just about less than half an hour from one another uh taking the mrt
mrt
okay
yah
so you would be able to get from one place to another within half an hour if you're going to use the mrt
alright
that's great
yah
so the next uh culture i'm going to introduce to you would be it's easy for you to get to the museum called the peranakan museum
again this is just near city hall mrt
peran
and this group of people were originally chinese people
but uh what they have done is uh we call them the straits borns so when they came to singapore the men first came and they inter-married with the local non-malay lady uh the local uh non-muslim ladies
and with it finally they evolved their own culture called the peranakans
yes
s so these people from china they were married too
the men
yes the men came from china and they inter-married with the local
local ladies
non-muslim ladies
non-muslim
uh so that's the peranakans
yah so this is a traditional dress
we call them just now those ladies they are wearing their kebayas
very beautiful clothes
so this will be the peranakan museum
so in this museum hm just
sorry
i'm sorry
in this museum um are they still strict in dress codes
uh no for the museum it's okay
you can just go
uh no strict dress code
uh but of course you know uh no swimming attire
yah
so you can go like just like shirts and shorts
yes you can wear shorts uh if you want to go to the museum
that's fine
okay
hm are there shows or cultural shows in this museum
uh most of the time there will be no cultural show
uh but at uh let's say certain events yes can uh there may be a show or a tour uh for the museum otherwise uh no for the time of may uh no we don't have like any special uh events that's going to come out
let's see any upcoming um
so so it's from octob~oct i'm sorry it's october till april am i right
uh october what do you mean
sorry
hm the events
uh no it all depends on uh whether i'm talking about uh event uh the museum would be on-going
alright
yes
let's see
i don't think there's any special events coming out in uh may
let's see may
any special events
hm yes
yes so what month do you have for the events in that museum
okay
we'll have to see
okay
usually uh during school holidays the museum have some uh special events that's played
yes
yup
okay
okay for the may thirteen i guess you have not arrived
yah this one is it's for the children
they have this make a bouquet of flower paper flowers uh with uh peranakan motif
alright oh that will be for mother's day
uh for mother's day
yah and otherwise the next event will be in june
uh yah
because that would be the june school holidays in singapore
so otherwise the museum it's very nice to visit
uh lots of things to see very different uh culture from the other two cultures that i'm talking about
okay
yes
okay
so let's see any there are i think there's no special uh events in the month of may except uh for may the thirteenth where they have this children's workshop for mother's day
yes
and then june
am i right that's june
yah
then yes otherwise the on-going uh exhibition will always be on-going so we always have the current uh exhibition
okay
so you will always see the current exhibitions and that's always on-going
but in the peranakan museum collection
yes
hm is it the clothes of the it's woman
uh yes we have uh the kebaya collection
but this one will end in eight of april
you will still see some uh small collection of kebayas
uh that's the traditional clothes of the peranakans
you will see a lot of uh cutlery uh crockery that were used by the peranakan which is very different from the other two culture
uh and of course you see like wedding uh rituals uh what do the peranakans do
uh even in uh death as well funeral um uh yah rituals
uh what do the peranakans do
how do their house look like
so basically that's what you're going to see in the peranakan museum
it's a very beautiful uh very colourful uh museum
yes
yup
yes
yup
okay
and lynnette for the peranakans um what are hm what is the religion of this culture or this people
okay because they were originally chinese men and they inter-married with local non-malay uh non-muslim ladies
so they are still very much uh traditionally
uh they are still very much uh buddhist
but uh along the way quite a number of them had converted to christianity
um buddhist
okay
so they actually mix uh in their house the traditional one
uh you still see chinese altars uh in the house
uh that's beautiful
and hm lynnette
yes
hm i think i've seen enough
and i'd like to thank you for this call and hope you had a good time
okay sure
yah
same to you and thanks for calling in
alright
thank you
okay
bye
bye
hi good afternoon
hi good afternoon
this uh this is uh tour guide number one and my name is lynnette
and how may i address you
uh i'm participant number sixty
okay and would i be able to get your name
sure my name is jo
hi jo
hi
it's yo uh your name is lynnette is that right
yes that's right
lynnette nice to meet you lynnette
hi
okay jo may how may i help you
oh yes um i like to uh plan a tour to singapore uh some time in i guess mid-august
uh that's when my birthday is
so i'd like to know uh where can i go what can i do for about two days
two days in singapore uh
yes
okay
now in august actually the first week of august singapore is going to celebrate our birthday
oh wow okay
but that would be mid-august for you
yes um i actually took a look at the calendar and about august seventeen eighteen nineteen that sounds about right
okay
so that should be uh saturday sunday hm no i'm sorry
friday saturday sunday if i'm not mistaken
and friday to sunday okay
and uh what are your what would you what are you thinking of doing here
actually um i'm not sure but uh i do love the beach
uh are there any beaches in singapore or even close by
okay we do have nice beaches on sentosa island
okay
oh i've heard about sentosa okay
so you could do your swimming and other activities on sentosa island
uh we do have also a beach on the mainland singapore uh but it's just a simple beach
alright
okay
okay and what do you mean by simple beach
it's not like uh white sands uh what do you mean by simple beach
because um i'm actually looking for white sands and very calm seas
so how are the beaches in sentosa and mainland singapore
okay the mainland of singapore we have our beach over at the east coast
uh so when i said simple uh yes we don't have white sand on the east coast beach
uh yes we have pretty deep sea water around the coastline of singapore
so i would say that is not very calm sea
okay so i would think uh sentosa beaches would be more to your liking because you have a beautiful beach out there in fact there are a few
uh and also uh very calm because the waters there are pretty calm
because you can actually swim inside the lagoon
okay
okay
okay
oh okay right
so i'm going to show you uh the sentosa
okay
alright i'm gonna just show you sentosa and i'm just going to show you some of the beaches we have
alright
okay this is one of them it's called siloso beach
and the other beaches would be pahlawan
okay
okay that's pahlawan coming up
okay you can see they are beautiful right
right it is
okay and the other one will be tanjong beach
wow
okay so they are all very nice beaches on uh sentosa island
okay impressive very good
okay this is the one the sentosa beach uh i'm talking about okay
so nice uh clean and calm waters i think that would suit what you are looking for
good
um is august a good month to go to sentosa
how's the weather like in singapore
uh we have summer the whole year around
so there is no uh differences on whether you are coming in january or december uh in terms of our weather
just in december the weather gets one degree cooler that's all
just one degree cooler
uh and what about the freak weather storms like uh tornados or hurricanes anything like that in singapore
is that common in singapore
yes
uh no we fortunately here we don't have uh the natural disaster because we yah
we don't have uh earthquakes we don't have tornados
uh what we have here would be just very mild monsoon rain
or i would say very heavy rains that's about it
wow
mild monsoon rains
okay and what month are those
um okay it's generally happening in uh the month of november
uh you can still come because uh although you may have heavy rains the rains do uh stop alright after a short while
uh so we do have people coming to singapore from january to december
november
alright good
um actually um i do see the site right now and um the beaches on sentosa
it's comparable to what famous beach around the world
uh i think we are very different
our beaches are i would say man-made alright
and uh they are very safe to swim because uh you have uh what we call lagoons
okay
lagoons okay alright
yes so it's safe to swim in the lagoons and also in the lagoons itself you have these buoys
so as long as you're just swimming inside the buoys you are actually i would say very safe
so if you are looking at the safe place uh to swim and very convenient to the hotels
uh that would something that i would recommend
alright
actually my main activity when i go to the beaches uh is snorkelling
uh is the water in sentosa is it good for snorkelling also
uh no we i would not recommend you to go snorkelling in sentosa
uh we normally do i would say scuba diving off uh the southern islands of singapore
oh why not
oh scuba diving
i've never gone scuba diving
uh it doesn't really interest me
so around sentosa thi so this is an island right
sentosa island okay
yah
yes it's an island of the southern part of singapore
alright and there are no locations for snorkelling
uh no yah
we normally would not uh do snorkelling uh on sentosa island
oh uh is there a place in singapore where we can go snorkelling
uh like i said no unfortunately
but uh we do more of uh scuba diving of the off-shores islands of singapore
okay would i be able to introduce you to a beach volleyball on the beach
no oh wow
beach volleyball
because uh actually i was thinking of going there with my family and uh my family really loves snorkelling
uh okay so what else can we do on the beach uh besides the usual volleyball walking on the beach
um so what else
okay on sentosa
so snorkelling is definitely out of the question right
okay
that's too bad
yes
yes
so on the sentosa there are so many attractions alright
uh will you be coming with uh small children or just for adults
oh uh actually it's uh my wife and my son my ten-year-old son and we all love snorkelling
but yah if you can tell me a few more things that we can do maybe uh you could convince us to go to sentosa
okay well uh i think that the your child would be interested in this uh attraction called the butterfly park and insect kingdom
okay
uh and in this small little park you get to see all this insects
and part of inside the park itself you will also be walking through an uh open-air as you can see you see the butterflies are just parked
or uh they just uh hang on to the person itself alright
okay so yah and as you can see the scorpion as well
okay so these are this is a small uh but very compact butterfly kingdom uh butterfly park and insect kingdom
and i think if your son is uh very much into a little bit more adventurous and a little bit more exciting or in fact your whole family yourself and your wife included you could go and do this mega-zip adventure park
it's like an obstacle kind of a park if you can see
okay oh i see
right
i see
so this is also found on the island itself
so you don't have to travel you know to many areas
uh you can do a lot of things just on the island itself alright
so this is one of them and another attraction you would also be interested in this it's called the skyline luge
okay
okay and what's that
okay this is like uh a bit like bumper cars
oh sky okay
yah but you are going downslope
okay you are going downslope so it's really exciting uh if you get on to this luge and you can do a one-way luge and the other way by uh skyline is the open-air cable car
kind of a thing yah
so these are the some of the games or sport you can do on uh sentosa itself
okay
alright sounds interesting
so this is not a resort or is this a resort
uh the whole island is resort
okay the whole island of sentosa
so we have different sections uh i've given you some of the attraction that is found on the island where you can do
okay
alright
okay
okay
alright
uh of course there are lot more
uh you can even climb up or take a ride into the merlion
okay and what's that
okay this merlion is a symbol of singapore
uh half lion and half fish tail okay
and yes so you can actually do uh a sort of uh go inside the lion and take the lift right up to the mouth of lion and have good eye view of uh sentosa and even towards indonesia
oh yes
oh okay so it's hollow inside
so people can actually go inside
yes
yes
alri um i'm guessing there is a fee for this right
how much is it
okay the admission into this merlion park is eight dollars for an adult and five dollars for child
so if your child is ten yes that would be child rate
oh that's uh singaporean dollars right
yes everything will be in singapore dollars
okay how much is that in oh what's the conversion rate for uh us dollars to singapore dollars
uh one us dollars will give you approximately about a one dollar and twenty seven cents singapore money
oh i see
okay
alright
okay so this one us dollar will give you approximately about a dollar twenty seven uh singapore uh money alright
so if you want to make things easier then it's about a dollar thirty cents
so one dollar is one twenty five uh huh i see
i see
okay i see alright
yah but it's actually less yah
it's about a one point two seven at today's rate
okay alright good
okay so uh there are other attractions but i will uh you know skip that
as you can see right there are a lot more attraction on uh sentosa itself
and of course in the night time you may want to do a show on sentosa
sure
i do
okay we have uh the song of the sea that comes on every night
um hm the song of the sea
yah it's call is a show it's a water laser and fire show
that comes on in the night time
the first show is at seven forty and it last about twenty minutes
okay
okay
seven forty okay
yah
so that is the show that you may want to do
and of course we have a theme park called universal studio on sentosa island
good for twenty minutes
yes
oh it's on sentosa island the universal studios
it's not on the mainland uh singapore
yes
yes
uh no it's on the uh sentosa island
it's on sentosa wow
okay so basically um when i was researching singapore and what we can do in singapore uh the universal studios was i think it was the number one thing to do in singapore
so i like to know a few more things about uh universal studios in singapore
so it is on sentosa island
not on the mainland okay good
yes correct
not on the mainland yah
so there are so these are just some of the scenes uh it's divided into seven zone
okay so these are just some of the scene
this is one of the rides
okay
okay and of course you can take photographs with the characters
well we have uh madagascar
madagascar alright
okay hollywood area
i have one question
um uh what is the peak season in august or is that low season or the lean season
what
oh we don't really have like a peak season
uh maybe you get a little bit more crowd in june and december because that is also our school holidays here in singapore
uh and of course some of the public holidays um then you get uh more local people
otherwise uh i think it would be fairly uh it is not like really crowded if you are going into uh the theme park
okay
alright
okay so in august uh so that's a perfect time to go to singapore
wow okay
yes
uh yah we don't have major holidays except on the ninth of august that's our birthday in august
oh uh when is the singapore birthday in august
uh ninth on the ninth of august
ninth of august that's perfect
yes
yes and we do have a big birthday parade um uh in singapore in the month of august uh ninth of august
otherwise uh the rest of august we don't have other major festival
i see
i see
i see alright
um is there a big difference is it better to go to uh this theme park on weekday or on weekend
i'm guessing it's better on a weekday
uh yes uh of course weekday then you don't have to um have a queue uh in the of course the more popular rides like the transformer rides
so weekday i would say uh yes we get lesser crowd
but even on weekend it is not like uh really so crowded as you have to squeeze-in your way uh no yah
right
right
right uh mu that's good because i've been to uh what's that place called in florida us
uh universal studio
uh the other one
uh disneyland or dis yah i've been there
disneyland
yah i've been there and the queues are it's crazy
uh for one ride it could take about may be twenty to thirty may be even to forty five minutes just to get on the rides but it's not that bad here in uh universal studio singapore
yah that i would say may be saturday sunday yes you do have to queue a bit of time
uh maybe the more popular rides would be like transformer yes maybe you do have to queue like fifty minutes over the weekends
uh but otherwise i think it's manageable
that's good news so unless if i'm going there um for two days and let say friday saturday the best time to go to universal studios would be on the friday
yes that's right
friday and then just go to the beaches on a saturday okay
yes correct
and do you want me to recommend your hotel to stay in sentosa island
that's good
i do yes
i see here uh at the very top uh this website is for uh resorts world
is that right
yes
yes
uh there are some hotels uh just within the universal studio area
there are some uh hotels out there okay
so you can choose to stay uh there as well
alright they are all relatively new hotels
okay um. uh are there any four-star hotels uh on the island
uh no we don't have a four-star hotel um the resort world hotel would be i would say they are different category of hotel because they are uh resorts hotels right
um and
right
okay there is one more hotel
remember earlier on i showed you the beach
right
uh okay there is uh resort uh hotel called the rasa sentosa
okay
the rasa sentosa
yah and it is actually the same chain as the uh shangri-la hotel
oh i see
so it's the same chain of hotel shangri-la and the rasa sentosa resort
yah but it's a different kind of category of hotel
this is resort
okay so this one i can recommend you um this would be uh the hotel out on uh the island
so maybe you can stay uh one night out there
okay
i see it's okay
sure is this beachfront or is this in the is this in land
uh it's a beachfront hotel
beachfront hotel alright
can i see some of the uh location
uh no uh maybe the rooms later
yah the location
i wanna see what's around this hotel or this resort
the rooms
oh the location
okay the location
okay just if you now you are looking at the uh this is the back of the re uh sentosa resort
uh in the front area you it overlooks the siloso beach
okay
yah remember just now i showed you the siloso beach
oh yes okay
yes so it actually overlooks the beach
and it's quite a pretty uh hotel
i see
okay and it's and the hotel is walking distance from the beach right
yes it's just next to the beach
oh it's right on the beach that's good
yah right on the beach yes
so it's a beachfront hotel
okay so this is uh rasa sentosa hotel
that's good
okay
and what are the rates like for this hotel
eh i okay i will show you the rates
and i guess we can do uh we can probably book hypothetically for august uh seventeen to eighteen just to see if they have available rooms on that
yah let's see whether they have uh okay
so you planning to tour august seventeen to august uh eighteen
alright let see whether
right
okay there will be two adults and one child
okay so it will show the rates
okay
oh yes it's available um
okay yah
so it is a friday
oh that's good
yah the rates uh would be singapor dollars uh four hundred and ten dollars per night
okay
it's not bad
yah and it right on the beach okay
so you could stay one night on the resort and the next day you can go over to the mainland
right
okay
right and um yes if we do uh decide to got the mainland uh what can we do there
because i always thought that universal studios was on the mainland
oh okay no it
yah that's so that's why i was planning to go to the mainland
but now your telling me that it's actually on sentosa island
so now if we go the mainland what can we do there
what can we see
alright
okay what do your wife yourself and your child like to see
i guess um if uh actually sentosa would be probably for me and for my son
but if we go the mainland i guess that will be for my wife
and she likes to shop so where can we to go shopping
alright
okay we had lots of shopping options in singapore
um even the locals like to shop and eat alright
so hm a lot of us goes to this road called orchard road to do our shopping
okay
alright i've heard of that
and yes
and you can you are actually looking at one of our uh newer shopping centre called ion on orchard road
if you look at the map below you see the pink highlighted area
that is orchard road
it's one straight road
okay
alright
alright and yes again you see some of the uh street seen in orchard road alright
full of greenery mature trees and every other building would be uh a shopping centre a hotel dining area on orchard road itself
oh i see
okay
yes and what would what does she likes to shop for
what do you think she will like to shop for
she actually likes to go to bargain shops
and i see here that uh we have pretty high-end shops on orchard road uh right
uh are there any places here or roads where they have bargain like for shops or the market
uh we don't really call our shops market here
uh but just on the junction of this building uh ion uh beside the main road is orchard road the other road is scotts road
so if you just walk down uh you will come to this shopping mall called the um uh far east shopping centre
okay now this sell uh the i would say the budget and mid-range kind of products uh that ranges from hair accessories uh ear accessories right up to fashion and shoes
so that is one option that you may wanna consider
all these shops are just one shop so they don't really have chain shops
uh so it's not like the high fashion
uh the other place that i would like to recommend uh for the cheaper options of shopping would be bugis alright
uh so this is an area another area again it's the shopping mall
uh i mean next to the bugis mrt train station if you look on your right-hand side
uh you can yah
yah you can see bugis junction
okay so there is a red building just a five minutes from the mrt uh and again there are all tiny shops
uh so if you want to talk about market then maybe that would be quite similar to what you are talking about
uh so there are no branded items there basically they are just uh fashionable wear
so this is the other shopping option
uh would you and your son like to look at any of our war museum federal
far east
okay
okay
that's good
um uh war museums
not too much war museums but if you have any science museums or a technology museums
my son is more interested in science actually
okay
so i would be able to recommend he uh you a science centre which a lot of school children they like to go to this uh place call the science centre
okay so this is uh a visit to the science centre and it's quite interactive as well
uh again it's very accessible
you can take the subway again the mrt and goes towards the western part of singapore
so this is the science centre and your son will well enjoy like a few hours uh in this science centre itself alright
so i'm going to show you like what are the exhibitions
okay in here there are all very interactive
okay inside here
okay so some of these are permanent exhibitions and they are always there all the time
but of course at certain time of the year they have different focus
so it's really very interactive very um stimulating actually for children as well as for adult
that's good
okay
i see
it looks pretty interesting
um how much is the entrance fee to this science centre
hello
yes
okay i'm giving you the rates
okay yah
alright
okay let me just
um actually you mention a lot of trips uh via the mrt
uh is it fairly simple to take the mrt to different locations or
yes uh it is very simple to take the uh mrt
okay and there are some english signs there right
that i can understand
yes there are uh signs are all written in english
so it's actually very easy to get by
uh we have just uh a few line alright at the east-west line and of course the reverse direction that is the green colour line
and north-south line will be in red colour
uh and uh north-east line uh that would be a purple colour
and a second line that is in yellow
okay
good
that's good
okay
okay
oh so it's very organised that's good
yes
so uh and of course it always go in reverse direction yah
so very easy to take the uh subway our mrt
right
okay that's good
and every
yah so
and uh most of the shops the locations and things to go to it is accessible via the mrt is that right
yes
alright and how much will it cost me to take the mrt in one direction
okay our mrt is charge as well based on uh distance travel
okay
alright
so let's say if you're in the east you want to travel down to let say orchard road that would be a cost of uh approximately about two dollars
two dollars
two dollars and twenty cents singapore dollars
uh yah so you since you're only going to spend like two days i would just recommend you to buy uh like the standard ticket
okay
uh the standard ticket and what's that
is that like an all-day pass
uh no you just buy like a per trip basis
per trip
uh is there uh a ticket like an all-day where i can use that and i can go anywhere i want uh with that ticket no
uh we have like uh not the one day pass uh but we have like a tourist pass
so because i don't think you're going to travel that much so i think it is cheaper if you just buy uh per trip basis
per trip basis okay
yes
okay so yah ea your earlier question like how much does it cost in science nine dollars uh for yes nine dollars the admission
uh for child up to sixteen years that would be five dollars
right
nine dollars
five dollars for three to six okay
yes
yah
so that's eighteen for five twenty three okay
not bad
yah
yah and of course we do have like a four d kind of a show
uh again it depends on what show it's gonna show in august
uh that's like in a three hundred sixty degrees kind of facility theatre
i see
alright and that's not included in the entrance fee right
uh no that's an additional of ten dollars
additional ten dollars and it's seven dollars for kids
three to twelve years old
yah
yes
but there is option huh whether you want to see this show or not
otherwise uh
i see
yah
alright
so basically um i'm actually uh off the top of my head
i'm calculating how much i would need if i were to go to singapore uh for two days
uh and going back to the resort hotel
uh if i remember correctly it was around four hundred fifty dollars is that right
yes correct
and that's per night
okay and um that doesn't include the dinner or breakfast lunch and dinner
uh no normally our hotels would include the breakfast
oh it would include the breakfast
yes
oh i see that's good
so i would just have to worry about the lunch and the dinner for my for myself and for my family
okay
alright
yes
correct
so like for if you're spending the whole day on sentosa island uh or in universal studio there are meals there are dining options available out there
oh okay
okay so you could have like a just simple meal um like a sandwich or something in the park
and for dinner options uh because uh you'll be spending uh quite a fair amount on your hotel stay
so maybe i can recommend you uh to do like our street food
oh is uh um are street food is available on sentosa island
uh yes we do have a food court uh located on sentosa island
uh for a meal with drink let's say a main course with a drink that would cost you approximately about ten dollars
okay ten dollars per person
per person
yah ten singapore dollars per person
alright and this uh food court on sentosa island uh they serve street food just like on the mainland
yes so you can have like uh fried hokkien noodles uh a fried carrot cake alright satay
satay yah i've heard of that
uh that first one you mention fried carrot cake is that right
yes
yes fried carrot cake
what's that
is that for breakfast
is that like desert
what is that
yah
ah okay yah
our fried be uh carrot cake version is very different from uh the american fried uh carrot cake or the european versions
uh this is a savoury uh kind of egg with white radish
alright
white radish
yes it's actually white radish that has been grated uh and with rice flour
so it's cooked like a little bit some of them cook it like pancake style
so it's the savoury and we can eat it for breakfast lunch or dinner
breakfast lunch or dinner
so the whole day
yah it's actually quite filling yah
so that is something that is uh i think not found in your country
so you may want to try that
wow
yah i think we do
actually um one of our things that we do is uh we try to taste as many of the street or the local foods as possible
and i think this fried carrot cake would be one of them if we do decide to go to singapore
anything else that we can try
anything exotic or uh maybe challenging to try
yah
challenging okay eating with your hands would be like either the chili crabs or uh pepper crabs this will be challenging
or if you really want something very exotic uh we do take uh the turtle soup in singapore
yah
oh okay
turtle soup
yes
but again not many um uh not many uh food court will offer this option
so you would be able to find them in chinatown for this particular dish
if you are talking about very exotic food
i see
okay and uh what else can we expect uh from the street food yah
uh we do have from the street food i think it will be like satay at uh at the satay club over at old uh lau pa sat
um hm okay and what's that
okay and that is okay what is satay
satay is marinated meat uh cooked uh pierced with skewers and it's cooked over charcoal
okay
alright
okay so that is satay
alright
and if things get a bit too maybe strange for my son uh my son really likes fast food
is there uh what are the fast food restaurants available in singapore
okay the fast food that is available here would ranges from mcdonalds uh mcdonalds right up to wendy's kfc
okay
okay
okay so yah
this would be some of the uh fast food that we have here
alright
alright pretty standard and stuff okay
alright so um i'm guessing uh with the accommodations uh with the food and the entrance fees uh maybe around seven to may be eight hundred dollars us dollars
is a good amount of money to have uh as a budget
okay that's good
so it's
yes
uh yes
yah
because if you are going to stay in a uh i would say uh um uh above let say about three to four hundred dollars stay in the res uh in the hotel then you could actually um of course take a chance to uh taste all our local food our street food in full
right
okay sounds interesting
okay so uh besides
let see anything else
yah this is what i'm going to show you is claypot rice
yes what is this
yah okay
it's a rice cooked in a claypot so you get this aroma and of course uh most of the time uh they have either you can ask for seafood or chinese sausage or chicken uh um in this dish alright
it's like one pot meal
yah so this is another food that you may want to try
oh so there is rice underneath and it's uh cooked along with the meat
yah meat and uh a bit of uh vegetables
and this is only for four dollars
uh yes uh in the non-air-conditioned food centre
oh that's fi oh what is the average temperature in singapore
yah
uh average temperature in the afternoon uh ranges from about thirty degrees to thirty two degrees uh any time of the year
uh in the mor in the evening from let say eight o'clock onwards uh the temperature will go down to twenty six degrees right up to the morning uh about seven o'clock in the morning
yah so we don't have drastic change of temperature
oh that's good
so the open air is just fine
yes
alright and this restaurant is on bugis bugis street or bugis what is that
ah okay
this bugis remember earlier on i also introduce to uh like a no brand kind of a shopping
right
orchid road
right
alright so in all our shopping centre there's always uh air-conditioned food court
uh but the bugis one it's open air so you can of course try this food it is sold in either uh air-condition food centre or non-air-conditioned food centre
the non-air-condition uh food centre would be the prices would be a little bit cheaper
so let say you could get it for four dollars and if you're going to have uh your the same kind of food in air-condition uh food centre then you pay about six dollars
okay
i see alright
oh i have one more very important questions
um my family and i went to india uh maybe a few years back
and the water there was not very uh potable
ri when we actually drink water there we got sick
so uh i guess i'm guessing that singapore does not have that problem is that right
right
oh n yes our water here is very clean
so if you don't really have uh very weak stomach we can actually drink directly from the tap
uh but of course again you are not so sure whether your stomach can take it or not
then of course i still recommend you to take the boiled water or yes or bottled water
but otherwise our tap water is very clean uh in singapore
okay
right
bottled water
okay
it's fine alright
because we try that in india and it was a bad idea
so thank you

okay welcome
bye
okay bye
hi good afternoon
hi good afternoon
uh this is tour guide uh number one and my name is lynnette
and how do i address you
i'm uh participant number twenty and my name is uh john
john
hi john
yup
i'm good
okay
so uh hi lynnette
hi yes and how can i help you
yes uh i would like to inquire about uh travelling to singapore for about two to three days with my wife
i need to uh you know take her on a short vacation
is this your first trip to singapore
yes this will be my first trip to singapore and i'm uh excited to go there
so first things first i uh want to uh check on the budget friendly hotels
so if you can recommend some hotels that i can afford
uh what would be uh the price range that you are talking about
okay maybe i can give you uh indication of the hotel prices here
it's uh let say about a hundred fifty right to two hundred dollars or two hundred to three hundred dollars budget range
yes maybe uh if i would be staying for around two to three days
yes we have uh so which price range are we talking about
the hundred uh and fifty to two hundred or slightly above two hundred to three hundred price range
yes something around a hundred to one hundred fifty a day
okay
okay uh and would you like something right in the heart of the shopping belt or you don't or you prefer something in uh the residential area in singapore
i would prefer something like in the commercial district where i can walk around and uh take a look at the sceneries and you know
uh just walking from one place to another would be good
and yup
okay
walking from one place to another
yah
okay
so commercial district meaning um more towards the shopping belt rather than the business district right
yah
okay
um there are some interesting hotels there
okay uh one of the hotels that i would be able to recommend you uh would be the rendezvous hotel
rendezvous hotel
yah
so how much uh they uh
what is the price for this hotel is it
yah how much are the uh
okay we are looking approximately about just slightly over two hundred dollars
the prices for hm that's quite expensive but i can uh consider that one
rendezvous hotel
yah because it's just walking to most of the uh places
so it's in the heart of the singapore commercial district
yes it is
otherwise there is another hotel uh call the grand park hotel
okay
grand park hotel so i can also check on this one
what are the rates for the grand park hotel
i've s sorry the price range is around two hundred
yah
two hun
slightly below two hundred a night
two hundred a day
uh yes
so that would this will be there uh regular suites
uh yes uh a standard room
alright
a standard room uh for one room
alright yah so this is the price range uh for the hotel
alright
and if there is a nearby restaurants within that hotel so if you could recommend some good restaurants like selling singaporean delicacies
local singaporean delicacy so maybe we could some out of those dishes
okay uh in this hotel itself uh they have a restaurant
okay they have a restaurant in this particular hotel
and yes they do serve some of our cuisine
otherwise i would also recommend to you uh just about ten minutes walk from the rendezvous hotel um you'll be able to get to one fullerton
one fullerton
yes and there is a restaurant there that serve a unique singapore uh food
one fullerton hotel alright
so uh maybe i can write that down and check on that
uh yes it's called one fullerton
alright
yah so uh there is a seafood restaurant
and of course a lot of people including the locals like to eat uh chili crab
chili crab
yes
alright
what are the other delicacies uh singapore is known for
except for the chili crabs
oh what other delicacy is it
yah
okay because we are multiracial here so we do have like the malay cuisine uh the chinese the indian
and we have another uh food that is also a favourite of a lot people is called peranakan food
what's that again peranakan
food
food
yes
alright
it's in-short it will be a chinese style of cooking uh but using uh more malay uh spices
so do you like spicy food or most singaporean foods are spicy
uh i wouldn't say most singapore uh food are spicy it's these are just different cuisines uh that we have in singapore
so yes but yes a lot of uh singapore people like to eat spicy food
alright
alright
and going back to the hotel uh if you could recommend some you know local attractions like park uh nearby zoos museums where people you know usually go from just walking around or like i know singapore is known for their uh the trains
yes
so if you have nearby uh attractions like what i mention earlier is there any nearby parks any zoos
to
from the hotel yah
the zoo
from the
from the hotel
yah from rendezvous hotel
okay
from rendezvous hotel you can uh walk to or i would say either you walk or you take this mrt train from uh city hall and you alight at raffles place mrt
you will be alighting and walking just above five minutes to the uh marina bay
okay so what can i see on uh marina bay
okay it's a beautiful bay
um you will be able to see uh the bay front which is very pretty
uh and of course the marina bay sands resort as well as the icon of singapore we call it the merlion park
uh the merlion is the uh ti uh lion head with a fish tail
okay so that is the um good photo uh stops uh for you to take some memories of singapore
so you can do that just walking distance
from or just uh one stop away from your hotel
yes
alright
so so that's the marina bay
so how many kilometres uh is that exactly from the rendezvous hotel
uh walking kilometres approximately about uh five kilometres
so i would think uh taking the train would be a better idea
alright
except for marina bay what else uh attractions can you recommend for me
uh would you want to see uh just tourist sports
yah anything that it can be uh you know looking forward to see
okay
uh okay in around the merli uh the marina bay uh it's also a wa a nice walk because uh you are just walking around the bay front
uh like i said it has interesting skyline there are some interesting sculptures uh along the marina bay area
uh and in the night time uh we do have a show that is um you don't have to pay for this show at the marina bay front
uh it's a laser water show uh on the marina bay itself
but that only comes on in the night time
and there is a very interesting museum on marina bay as well it's called the arts and science museum
yah i also like to acquire on uh go to some of your museums
so what is that again
what's
the arts and science museum
art and science museum alright
arts and science museum uh in the marina bay okay so
so so it's inside the marina bay or it's beyond or it's just uh walking distance from the marina bay itself
uh it is actually just next door
the um building itself is shaped like a lotus flower
okay now i'm showing you uh how this arts and science museum looks like
it shaped like uh a lotus flower
okay this is the arts and science uh museum
so everything dedicated to arts and science and of course at certain time uh eh we have special exhibit alright
the last exhibit was the uh titanic exhibition
and this is actually a world-class exhibition
yah
and earlier on you mention uh you also want to do the zoo as well right
yah we can also consider um going to some zoo parks
alright the zoo will be located in the northwest of singapore
uh and in this zoo you will see our largest collection of the orang-utan
well going back to the hotel from the rendezvous hotel
yes
yah how many kilometres uh from the hotel to that zoo
uh approximately about twenty kilometres
so should i take the mrt again
yes you will take the mrt from city hall
you take the north line and you alight at uh ang mo kio station
and from there uh you would take a bus to go
okay
you will go yah yes and you take a bus to the uh zoo
the singapore zoo
yes this is open in the daytime
in the daytime only
so what time do they usually open
okay
yes
uh the park actually opens at eight a.m. in the morning
and up to what time
uh six p.m
alright six p.m. the singapore zoo
yes this is the singapore zoo and you will see uh mammals in this zoo
alright so uh like i said uh lots of uh is we have the largest collection of the orang-utans
uh there is a show in the zoo uh that you can watch
so the show varies from the time of the year or it always frequent the zoo
they always have some shows there
uh no it goes on every day
alright every day we have this show
uh in the morning uh it will be eleven o'clock
and in the afternoon it will be four p.m
alright my kids will uh definitely love to see those animals
yes so this is the uh show which is interesting alright
but our show is not like the circus kind of show
it just uh shows you yah what the animals uh do alright uh in the wild as well uh what they do
alright
yah
alright and by the way uh by taking the mrt train uh how much is the uh usual fare that they uh that i need uh to purchase
you will buy your ticket from the mrt train station
we would have a ticket a few ticket machines
and uh you will they will tell you where which location you are now at and you just tell them you just press the button which destination you are going to stop and the machine will tell you how much to uh uh how much is the fare
uh you just have to use singapore money to purchase your ticket
so how much usu
the machine will als yes so it all depends on uh where you're taking from and where you are going to stop
uh the price range will range from a dollar forty cents uh right up to two dollars and twenty cents
per person
okay
dollar and twenty cents
so going back to the rendezvous hotel again uh is there any more interesting place uh beyond the vicinity of that hotel
yes
okay beyond the vicinity of the hotel of course there are shopping areas on orchard road uh and then you walk to the merlion park or you take the mrt
uh otherwise you can uh walk to the museum we have the national museum out there the uh singapore arts museum
or do you want to consider doing ethnic places in singapore
hm yes uh maybe i can consider going to an ethnic place
uh which ethnic place do you want me to recommend
yes
uh which ethnic place would you want me to recommend
anything
is it
yah anything just beyond you know the vicinity of the hotel
okay uh would i be able to introduce uh you uh to the indian quarters
indian quarters
a traditional indian place where the indians when they came to singapore most of them live in this area
so we have preserved this area and we call it little india
oh okay it's like a chinatown where the do chinese lives and this place is the indian place
yes
so we have another area called chinatown
and uh this other place would be called little india
and there is another malay area call kampong glam
kampong glam
malay you means like uh the malaysians
yah
uh well the malays in singapore of course uh the some of them were native in singapore
uh but our some of the malay ancestors came from the nearby uh countries of malaysia as well as indonesia
so we would call eh and of course uh yah the nearby islands
generally we call this area the malay archipelo
malay archipelo okay
yes so uh but of course the people here who are malay and if they are locals here they would have been born here
uh most of the people here would be third generation uh singaporeans
their ancestors will probably come from the nearby countries for the malays
alright
so maybe on my second day at singapore uh i would prefer to transfer to another hotel
uh maybe like the first one is on uh the business district
maybe you could um provide me some information on the province like surroundings
like in the city any more
uh sorry i don't understand you
maybe you could provide additional information like uh if i will travel or transfer to another hotel uh maybe you could provide some suggestion
not on the commercial district but on the somehow provincial ones
provincial as in the residential area
yah maybe at the residential area
okay there is uh hotel called uh the link hotel
i l i n k. and it is located in uh a residential area a very old residential area uh call tiong bahru
it is also a very accessible location because there is the mrt uh that is located um just about less than ten minutes walk to the mrt
so the m so the mrt passes by this area also
yes about ten minutes walk from this hotel
so or if you look at the uh photograph
the first photograph of the front facade of the hotel uh this was originally residential area
uh it's a building that is originally residential but they have now been converted to a hotel
okay and do you recommend uh ano uh an attraction uh nearby this hotel
and what are the rates on this hotel
okay the attractions near to this hotel like i mention uh this is in a residential area
so you would be um going to a market alright that opens in the morning from uh seven thirty to twelve o'clock
so this market is what we call a wet market
uh they will sell fish meat fruits vegetable in this market sold
and you will be meeting a lot of local people uh when you visit the market
so it's something i would say interesting uh because these are not the normal uh tourist site
so you get when you stay in this hotel you get to interact with a lot of the local because majority of the people that you meet uh around your hotel area would be local
yah i think okay so this is not uh your popular tourist destination in singapore
uh i wouldn't say it's not the normal tourist belt you know
because you are uh located in an area uh that is very much residential
but this a nice uh boutique hotel
alright what are the rates in this hotel
okay uh the rates uh of course again it depending sometimes they do have promotions uh in uh certain uh during certain dates
alright but it should be in the range of about two hundred uh dollars
per day
two hundred to
uh yes per day
per day meaning uh from let say today it's starts at two o'clock or three o'clock to the next day uh check out eleven or twelve o'clock the next day
hm so i'd like to get one of the promotions
yes so uh again we have to see whether let say if you're going to arrive
because i'm planning to go there by april
april
okay let's see whether there's any promotion in april
uh which date are we talking about
maybe april ten
april the ten
april ten to eleven
okay right
we were going to have two adults and one kid
okay
alright let see
is there any promotions for this particular period
okay this rate is not available here
oh this one uh the link hotel daily set meal promo from march one to uh may thirty first
yes
would you be able to make it for this date
yah uh i can catch up on the date
and if you could uh provide the links of that certain hotel
so maybe we can book in advance
uh it's just called uh link l i n k
link
hotel singapore
alright
so they uh allow online booking for this hotel
yes they have uh online booking for this hotel yes
so like the promotion oh yes they have oh no that is the set meal promo for that period of time in may
uh yah for the month of may
alright
okay and uh we have something quite interesting out there
uh over the weekend a lot of people uh would be bringing out their birds
the owners
come again
birds
just at the corner of the link hotel you have this like uh a birds corner
the owners of the birds they'll be bringing out their birds in their cages and they
yah so and they will
oh birds ah okay
yah the birds yes
so uh the owners will just have a chit chatting session with their friends
and the birds gets to meet their friends as well
so it's something a little bit unusual
uh again you don't see in the mainstream kind of uh tourist area but you get to see this in our housing state
yes
or residential area
and that is somehow uh different
okay
yes it's a different experience for uh the bird corners
and uh also uh the market you know pay a visit to our market
again it's a different experience altogether
and for food wise uh just above the market there is uh open-air not open-air it's a non-air-condition food court
so you can have your breakfast over there you can have lunch or you can have dinner
yes
alright
that sound very nice
so any other thing uh that you like to do or your son would like to do
uh not at this time
uh maybe on the april time when we go there uh we can uh go directly on your recommended place
and we're considering going back around december this year also
so maybe would we can stay on a different place
yes if you are coming in december again it's something different
uh then i would recommend that you stay right in the heart of orchard road
uh because in december we light up the whole street of orchard road to the marina uh area
so the street looks uh like a wonderland
uh and the buildings the hotels will be also specially decorated for christmas
so it's wonderful time to visit in december
the orchard road so any recommendations there if we might consider going back
okay you can stay at the elizabeth hotel
that is just ten minutes walk up to the orchard road area
okay elizabeth hotel
elizabeth hotel so can you please show us show me
yah
again it's not like uh that big a hotel
and it's
so the rates yes
so the rates here are um still uh affordable
yes the rates are still affordable
okay i'm showing you elizabeth hotel now
okay it still in the price range of about two hundred
but it is a nice uh small hotel uh not that big hotel and it just walk ten minutes or less uh to the main uh orchard road shopping area
okay so this is the elizabeth hotel and do you want me to show you uh the christmas time how does the street look like
yes i would like to see that
okay i'm gonna show you uh the christmas light-up uh in uh last year
okay this is how uh the street uh looks like
by the way is the orchard road accessible from the first hotel that you've mention the rendezvous hotel
if like we could travel from the rendezvous to the orchard place
yes you can it's just uh a walk of about ten minutes and you are in uh orchard road
alright it doesn't that is so near
yes
so it's also uh interesting place uh to stay and you can see this is the last year the christmas light-up in orchard road
it looks like a christmas wonderland isn't it
yah
so the whole place lights up with christmas lights
yes and every year the theme will change
so uh this year two zero one two would be different from last year
alright
so last year would be uh all the uh winter kind of uh feeling
uh this year will be different theme and it's the light up stretches from the beginning of orchard road right up to the marina area
uh it's a pretty long stretch of road that is lighted up
so the whole commercial district is kinda connected to one another
yes just one straight road down
uh orchard road is a pretty straight road all the way down to the marina square
so the rendezvous hotel is on that vicinity also so we can walk around the area and get to get a chance to uh come by along the orchard road
yes
yes correct
you are somewhere between rendezvous is somewhere between orchard and the marina square area
alright but we cannot see christmas lights on april
uh yes no christmas lights in april
only in december
all right
uh i think that's all
uh thank you for um the suggestions
and i'm glad that now you could show me around singapore and uh
are you sure you um have uh most of the information that you need
oh basically that's all i need
uh i need hotel uh suite rates restaurants uh nearby attractions interesting places
uh one last thing though uh except uh aside from those things uh what can you recommend more uh if i'd like to you know go back to singapore on a yearly basis
yearly basis
yah
then i would recommend that you spend uh more time uh exploring the area
and of course we have a lot more other interesting museums for example war museums in singapore we have uh nice parks uh wetland parks if you like something and you get wet
specially for your kids we have wildwest uh wet and wild uh in the eastern part of singapore
and we have recently also open-up in the eastern part of singapore northeast um a very interesting park uh at the uh pasir ris uh area
so these are parks which uh again a lot more locals would be visiting
uh they are usually located right next to the uh river area
so this uh establishments are just newly opened
uh not all are newly open some are the older ones
uh but our latest one would be the one at pasir ris
par series
yes it is um on the east northeast of singapore
northeast side
if you mind can you uh please show me that one
sure
pasir ris alright
yah
so it's a park actually
yes it's a park uh nice to stroll around in the evening uh morning
uh we have like uh uh mangrove area
so it's more like a wetland place
uh not just wetland uh you can see this is the town park
okay
so there's a swimming complex in there
uh this is not meant for swimming it's just a park
but it's just a good scenery
see this is very nice to walk around there are broad walk for you to walk
lots of greenery
okay so this is uh and we have interesting parks all over the uh all over singapore alright
so you could see uh a lot of the areas the residential areas we have one of this park so uh you get to see greenery not just uh buildings and not just shops in singapore
alright
so this map is the whole of singapore
yah this is a map of singapore okay and we have like if you look at the uh parameter uh most of this we have some parks out there
you could see uh the shaded area on the uh right-hand corner
that's pasir ris park
alright
alright
oh so it's beside the changi airport
yes correct
yah uh lynnette
yes
yup thank you for time
uh i know uh i can thank you for that uh i already got you know the relevant information from singapore so maybe on april i can consider going to the place that you've mention
yes sure
so we will hope to see you soon
yah
alright thanks for calling
yup thank you
okay bye
hello
hi um this is participant number twenty five
my name is arlyn
could you spell your name again please
um it's a r l y n
oh arlyn i see
i am tour guide number two and my name is jeanne
good morning arlyn
hi jeanne
hi arlyn
how can i help you
um well you see my husband and i will be celebrating our wedding anniversary coming may and we're sort of thinking um going on a tour in asia maybe
uh can i have your dates again please
um some time this may
okay in may
and so the dates are flexible you are not uh you haven't book anything yet
no not yet
what are your interests
um well um one of the places that we'd really like to go to for this tour will probably be singapore
i have heard a lot of good things about it and maybe that's a very good place to start
yes singapore is a hub for the rest of southeast asia uh we have also very good connections by air and by sea
but what particularly are is your husband and you uh what do you normally do when you're relaxing
alright
so for this particular tour since we're gonna probably bring along our daughter with us we're sort of thinking um probably going to a theme park maybe
a theme park okay
how old is your daughter
um she's four
oh she's only four years old okay
yah
uh but at four years old uh some of the rides she may not be able to take
you can visit the theme parks but uh like the roller coaster rides and all that they may have restrictions on uh on the height or the age of children for some of the rides because of her size
uh hm i totally understand
will there be anything else that you would probably recommend aside from that
you can bring her to the gardens uh you can bring her to the zoo and also the bird park and the night safari
oh i am very interested about the night safari can you tell more about that please
uh night safari
can i uh show you about the uh singapore wildlife reserves that runs all three parks
oh please do
just give me a moment
okay
so what you're seeing is an aviary where the birds fly free within the jurong bird park
and this the night safari tram ride which you can take uh if you are too tired to walk or you can walk as well as you know take the ride
you can do both if you have time
okay
so what time does the night safari usually open
if uh you can go in a little bit earlier but they won't let you ride inside to take the tram ride until after the sun goes down which is seven o'clock
uh those are tapirs that you see along the ride
now this is the day zoo can you see elephants of asia
yup i surely can
so this is one of the shows that you see at the zoo which is next to the night safari
so you should visit
uh if she likes the zoo very much because they have a children's uh playground area in there and she can take a little uh like a train around the zoo uh in the children's playground
she can also uh see you know pet the little animals the small ones that are like rabbits and uh pygmy horses you know
the very small and tame animals she can uh do rides and she can handle them and the shows are directed at children
right
so that sounds really interesting
i'm pretty sure my daughter is gonna love that because she loves animals really
um will there be like activities um like feeding the animals or riding the small animals maybe
yes there are uh times where you can ride the elephants or the horses in the zoo
uh at night we have a tribal show uh at the night safari where they recreate what the tribes do in borneo
oh that sounds interesting
so um what i'm seeing right now these are different places right
the bird park the night safari river safari and the singapore zoo these are all different places am i correct
yes that's right they because they are run under one organisation known as wildlife reserves
so it is one under one umbrella organisation and that means you can buy a package ticket with a built-in discount
and
okay
um for all of them
yes for all of them
normally you have a month to use up the ticket but so if you're staying just two or three days you would definitely use it up
wow
um can you tell me more about um the river safari
okay river safari is new
and it takes you from one part of the zoo to another part and you're lucky because it has just opened
so of course you're not going to go to all those rivers that was shown just now but it's a simulation
um okay
so here you go you can see uh crocodiles baby crocodile here
so what other activities do you have um in the river safari
will there be boat rides available
yes you take the boat and you can see the exhibits and on the boat ride the guide will show you um you know the skin the moult of the uh snakes
things that you don't normally see when you uh just visit a zoo but when you take the ride you can see exhibits that they have collected
you know when the animals die they have these specimens
oh i see
that sounds really nice
i'm
now the panda that you just saw they have not yet come
uh okay
but they are coming okay so we are just uh waiting for them arrive
so this is just opened last january
yes this uh night uh the river safari is uh a new trail
they had a river ride all along but now they have enhanced it
oh i see
so you see at the bottom there the different zones
so they are trying to re-create these zones within the river safari
it seems to me as if this is gonna be a very big place
uh yes it is
uh it's uh forty hectares if i remember correctly the riv the whole zoo
oh my goodness
yah
uh they actually have ninety hectares in total but they haven't develop the whole area
so uh the night safari uh shall i show you pictures of that
oh yes please
night safari gives you uh very magical feel because here we have nocturnal animals and also some animals that are both nocturnal and diurnal
so we have settle lighting uh at where they feed and then they will put food at these places
it's actually token feeding
it's to encourage the animals to be in the light so you can see
and some like these tapirs they are tame enough for them to roam around along the trails
so sometimes they stop and uh uh let they have to stop to let the tapirs have right of way
well i can just imagine that right
um well definitely i'd like to see um any of these places that you've just shown me cause like i said my kid just loves animals so this is probably something i have to put on my agenda when i go to singapore
you can take photos in the zoo and the bird park but not at the night safari uh at the animals
you can take when they are doing the show you can take cozying in the open areas but not at the animals because we won't don't want to spook them
yah
that's the only thing
right
uh would you know how much this is gonna cost to have a package ticket for all of these places that you've just shown me
okay
uh do you want to see the zoo
did i show you the zoo
i show you the zoo first and then i give you the package ticket okay
okay
that will work
that's the naked mole rat that's why they called it the nudist colony
you're not going to
make sense
you won't see naked people there don't worry
okay
and here you see
if you go early enough you can breakfast with wildlife
are you getting it on your screen
yes i definitely am
the three animals at the back that look like hairy monkeys they are orang-utans
that you normally have to go into the forest to see uh but here some of them are actually bred in our zoo and they are trained so they come out and you can take a photograph with them even your daughter
that would make a good souvenir photograph yah
yah definitely
and we have
but they don't like um these orang-utans that you've shown me here they don't like um grab the food on your plate when you're having breakfast do they
uh no because uh where you're eating is separate from where they are and they have a buffet of fruits that they are eating
so they don't come and help themselves to your food
you can also go to the fragile forest which is an open area and you're looking at i think some lemurs at the back there will be butterflies fluttering birds flying around it's an open area to show you the ecosystem in a forest
uh so the specimens inside or rather the exhibits inside there are all tamed and quite friendly
that's nice
including the two-toed sloth
you know the very slow moving sloth that uh it's up the tree
it's very hard to see in the jungle you can see it here
yup
yup
hm i see
and we have the sea lions that do a show you can get your daughter to take part in the show
are you there
yup i'm definitely there
i'm looking at the pictures and i am thinking of the activities that you know we'd probably do when we get there
yah
you can volunteer uh your daughter when they asked for volunteers at the bird park show and also at the uh day zoo tour and if they selected then she'll be the star of the show
i'll probably take a video of her
yes that would be fun isn't it
oh yes
especially yes having your wedding anniversary
so shall i show you you were asking about ticketing right
yup
yes ma'am
uh oh just hold on a minute
oh i think it's wait
okay
can you see the park hoppers specials
yup
so three in one because if you go to all three parks you are paying only fifty eight dollars
alright
and if you visit just the night safari and zoo it's forty eight
there is a saving because the individual tickets are costed at a higher price
alright i got that
and you see you can use it within a month within thirty days
s the only thing is it doesn't uh oh it includes the night safari tram ride but uh not the tram ride within the day zoo
so if you want to take a tram within the singapore zoo in the day time you have to pay about five dollars or so for the tram ride
alright got that
you can also walk uh after you do your tram ride if you have time because then you can see uh on the night safari different set of animals and the day zoo she can get closer up to all the animals
uh hm okay
so i was about to ask you a question but i'm actually reading the answer from what you're showing me
so it says there that visits to the three park need not be in one day so i got my answer just right there
yah
yes that's right you see thirty days to use it up
so you could even take one at a time
right
but if you go to the night safari and the zoo uh at the same time because they are next to each other you save on the fare and the time you save time travelling
you can visit the zoo starting from morning till evening or you can visit it in the afternoon till about six o'clock and then just walk across to the night safari
i see
okay
okay
uh do you want to see pictures of the tram ride
um i think i'm good
you're okay huh
yup
alright
i'm okay with the zoo
what about um cultural shows
you have like cultural shows there
cultural shows uh we have activities if you're thinking of your daughter we have activities within our museums targeted at children
uh but uh culturals shows no we have more the adult theme shows
okay
can you show me that too
okay
you're talking about normal cultural shows uh nothing to do with the zoo right
right
cause i was thinking since we're there anyway might as well experience the culture right and see how different it is from where i come from
okay
uh what i'm showing you is actually a show that just shown uh in a resort
but if you are talking about chinese malay indian dance we used to include it on a city tour but uh it's not really uh a show that you just go on and see you know um like in many other places
okay
okay
but when you're here if there are shows at our esplanade which i will show you later you might want to book them
just give me a minute to get you the resort the sentosa resort
uh the mar we have a re big resort on sentosa island
okay
what you can see i don't call it cultural actually it's uh got uh pyrotechnics
so if you like the beach and you go to sentosa you can see this show
so it's not the traditional cultural show you know what i mean
yup
but your daughter might enjoy this it's uh full of colour you can see there
and there's probably music there too huh
yes music
uh before that uh the people will be encouraging you to sing along with them
so this is more high-tech it's what i think people like today
so you go there in the evening can you see the times here at seven
um yup seven forty
and eight forty
and because it's popular they have an additional show on saturdays and public holidays usually there's an additional show
ei yup
i see
i might check that out too
yes
uh if you go to sentosa island you go to the beach this is just uh along the beach
um i see
so what's the difference between your premium seats and your standard seats
uh i think premium seats are more in the centre and let me scroll down i think these are premium seats
perhaps padded there you are
so you pay for the cushioning and you get a very good view
well i might just you know sign up for a what you call that a standard seat and then bring my own cushion or something
but i think here you'll get a better view
you are right in the centre so that you can see it very well
alright
uh there's another show and it's called the voyage de la vie it is at the sentosa resorts
can you show that to me as well
yes just a moment
so i know i'm not answering your question directly about cultural shows
oh no that's fine
you're doing a great job jeanne don't worry
these are more fun things that uh singaporeans also go to enjoy
and i have seen this show myself
uh there's a lot of acrobatics uh very spectacular
uh the cast is international
well like i said well i really want to see it would be something that you know not the every day thing that we usually see here
yah
so there you see it's uh our longest running show
hm so how long has it been running there
oh i can't remember exactly
i don't know if this they tell it here but i saw it months ago it's ninety minutes
it's a circus uh theatre production and oh i didn't even know it's created in singapore through a celebration of song and dance
it's full of activity so one and a half of hours
the story is simple about a young man on a journey but it is more you see the dancing you see the acrobatics
and this happens like every day
yes every day uh i think
uh let me see they must have a day off probably
okay
they are taking from wednesday to friday from october the first yes
so that means i think monday and tuesday is their day off
alright
okay
i for sure the acrobats they need a break so wednesday and friday at eight thirty but saturday and sunday they have a matinee show
uh because it's so popular they want to have a earlier show so some people take the show and then they uh do the songs of the sea after that
that's nice
and i think
i think it's their annually from twelve to twenty third of september
yah
their break their vacation maybe
okay
hm i'm looking at the prices
so hundred eighty eight is probably the nearest seat to the stage right
yah
frankly you don't need to have the hundred and eighty eight dollar tickets
uh i think hundred and eight is good enough already
and that's the same fee for let say or do they admit kids like my daughter's age
they yes i think they do let me see
they don't have child rates though
so kids have to pay the same rate as adults
alright
okay
the theatre isn't very large i don't know the actual capacity but i was inside and i think it's not like so huge that if you pay hundred and eight dollars you can't see very well
some people don't have the performers right you know too near them it could be scary
so uh hundred and eight dollars would be fine
okay i got that
hm i think i'm gonna have my agenda full
yes
what about shops
can you recommend shops maybe that you have
uh high-end shops we have down at orchard road which is the main tourist belt with the more expensive hotels or the better class hotels
uh then we have also shopping malls uh just in front of sentosa there is vivocity and harbourfront
vivocity is newer and it has got uh a very huge singaporean following on uh weekends
i'm showing you orchard road on the screen first
okay
so you can see we've got gucci there
it's you can get all the good brands there but there are also shops that sell things like g two thousand do you know it
yup
a mid-price range
but the concentration of branded shops would be at orchard road and also at marina bay sands where that we have a casino
so what sort of shopping are you looking for
um nothing in particular maybe
um i was thinking of just you know um checking the shops out and see you know what could probably be in of interest for me and my husband or my kid
okay if since you're celebrating your wedding anniversary your husband might want to buy you you know something very grand
do you see this picture here
i hope you get to talk with my husband
uh so this is marina bay sands it's the other resort in singapore and it's down by the bay
it's not very far from sentosa in fact
can you see the building
yup it looks very nice
so right on top is the swimming pool but uh
right on top of it
yes
is that an infinity pool
yes
uh actually infinity pools scare me a little bit i think i'm going to swim right out to see
well don't go near the edge then
stay away from it
okay we have here uh let me go to the shopping alright
we have a list of shops here
oh you have to search for the store let me see
so what's your favourite shop jeanne
um i'd like to go to an old store that has kept up with the times and modernised and it's called c k tang
tangs is the short form t a n g and it's at vivocity just in front of sentosa island
uh here you see this is a list of the shops you get at marina bay sands uh or rather it's categorised by what you want
so what is your preference i can select for you
um what about jewellery
jewellery
okay these are the stores we have bulgari uh cartier all the branded uh
have you checked up some of them
uh from the store window
citigems is i think it's local tio tianpo also
so you should be able to get prices that are not so um high-end over there
so can you see citigems on your screen
uh hm i can
so this is a huge shopping area called the shoppes at marina bay sands can you see on the right hand side of your screen
so this if you want to spare your husband you go to citigems
if you want to break his bank you go to some of the other store
the cartier or something
yes
uh anything else you want to see by way of shops
um i think i'm good
um maybe we can talk about the hotel next
okay
you haven't selected your hotel huh have you
uh no not yet
i'm really just at the planning stage right now
okay but uh
i will
we have got marina bay sands still on the screen so we'll have to wait for it first and then we search for your hotel
ah okay
cause i would rather have as much information as i can at this point before we finally decide
okay
i want to suggest to you this hotel in chinatown
it is quite romantic
it is a boutique hotel oops
you see the building was built in nineteen twenty nine hence the name of the hotel but it was bought over by a young man who likes to uh restore old buildings
and so it's a protected building and it's been converted into hotel rooms
okay
and here you see the facade of the hotel
it's got bay windows
the rooms are very interesting uh that he even has a suite on the uh top floor
so you don't have dates you're just talking about may is it
uh hm may
right may
okay
may
will there be available rooms
uh we can check shall we start
what day in may are you thinking of
um probably not a weekend uh maybe midweek or something
not a okay
what about wednesday maybe
wednesday the ninth
because may day would be on the first
uh if they have higher rates on that ti at that time they might be charging a bit more
oh really
yah
room so are you taking one room or two rooms
um one room
one room is enough huh
yup
uh one room
because your daughter is only four or we can put it as two guests but you can ask for an extra bed when you are there
yah
but this hotel is safe right
i mean
oh it's very safe
it's in the heart of chinatown
being a being a very old hotel it's not gonna crumble down on me is it
oh no it's uh you saw the picture it's been totally refurbished
yup
okay
and totally renovated
and i have in fact visited it when uh it was uh completed and they have uh even a room where you can have uh a bath looking out into the sky
hm that's interesting
uh i did we did step into the bathroom and check out because you know around there are skyscrapers all the hotel uh buildings and uh office buildings but they have a lot of greenery around and so that it shades off it shades you off from the view of anybody nearby
superior room is called the terrace suite can you see the price
that's the one with the bathroom that you were talking about earlier
yes
yes
it's quite fun actually if you are not the shy type
but unfortunately i am
you are
it is uh quite okay you should actually check it out and have a look
it's just that you know uh this is quite nice because it's right at the top of the hotel the hotel has just about three storeys
uh you can also take uh junior suite then
do you have pictures of that
okay
yes
here we go
junior suite i'm trying to get a picture of it for you
so junior suite that was the next category to the terrace
so can you see everything is new in there
it's really nice jeanne
it's just that i think with the price of the junior suite i might not have enough money to go to the places that i want to go to
uh you should have enough
uh what was the price of uh your show it's a hundred and eight dollars right
um hm. that's for one person right
but the yes uh so in fact you have we have tickets at forty eight dollars if i remember correctly
uh the junior suite is two hundred plus like two hundred and fourteen dollars
that's for one day
yah
so you stay in two days is that right
right
so that's gonna be around four hundred already plus you know the add-ons
seven hundred over dollars yah
so
you have to go down on your uh expectations for the show
you need to downgrade on your show
or maybe downgrade on the room
what about the other rooms can we check those out as well
okay
this room is a hundred and ninety six dollars deluxe room
okay that will do
yes that would be under two hundred dollars
how is it different from what's that superior double
uh superior double maybe the fittings i'm not sure
you want to see superior double
yah let's take a look
yes it's the fittings it's a little bit simpler
i think the deluxe room is a lot better don't you think
yes uh very nice very pretty
and you may notice that deluxe and the suites have the same decor
right
and you have your own wash basin right next to you
okay
so maybe you downgrade on your show price tickets
so your rooms uh
so maybe uh
i'll maybe go for the deluxe room then and we'll definitely go to the um zoo for my kid
the zoo price was about sixty dollars right
uh somewhere around that just a minute
right
okay
do you want to see the sup you don't want the superior double huh
um well do you have other pictures
because from the picture that i looked at earlier um
okay
no s okay that's the only picture we have of the room
yah
so we close this
so this is the room you want
yup
yes it's two hundred and fourteen dollars so four hundred and twenty eight dollars
uh do you want to see the show at forty eight dollars or fifty eight dollars
um maybe i'll put the safari thing on top of my list for my daughter's sake
safari price was about sixty let me see i forget the price
package price for the three in one for the night safari zoo and the bird park right
the wildlife reserves
cause i was always also thinking that two days might not be enough to you know to cover everything
if you are staying two whole nights one night for the night safari and one night for the show
so let's see the rates
uh the package price is what you want right
okay
so yah it's about sixty dollars
it's fifty eight dollars for the three of you
uh for one of you
so let's take it at sixty so it's about a hundred and eighty dollars for your
hm but uh but i see that the price for the kid is uh different it's only thirty eight dollars
oh yes
thirty eight dollars so it's only a hundred and sixty dollars
so you have spent uh four hundred almost five hundred dollars
so i think i have money for the show then
yes uh but not on a hundred and eight because you want to eat right
you want to unless you have a separate budget for that
of course
uh can you downgrade to the fifty eight dollar ticket for the show
wouldn't that be too far or do you think that's just right
no it's not too far because as i said the hall isn't very big and the performers are right in front of you you know
it is uh you get a good view
okay
then how much is that again fifty eight dollars
yah fifty eight dollars is one of the lower price range well take it at a hundred and eighty dollars for the three of you
of course there's no child ticket
so you have seven hundred and sixty eight dollars spent more or less now
so what about you know the ride from the hotel going to the zoo and the show
hm it will not uh break the bank
uh maybe you shall pay uh twenty dollars or twenty five dollars for the ticket uh it's called the ez-link card for you know when you travel by train and by bus
you use this card to pay for your fare so you don't have to use any money
so you just buy that card and then you use it for your bus and train rides correct
that's right
and then before you leave any balance value you can get a refund
so how much do these ez cards cost
uh at the airport you pay twelve dollars
here you go can you see
and
oh there you go
yah
and you would have to top up some money so or maybe you allow thirty dollars for it just to be safe
so you don't have
thirty dollars for one person
yes
so you don't have to go to a seven eleven store to top up the value if you run out
hm i see
then you'll get your change before you leave your airport you go to the counter and get a refund
so the thirty dollar value that do you think that will be enough for the entire duration for the trip or um how much just one person usually spend going around
uh it depends on how far you are going and the places you're going to except for the zoo and uh bird park is the further
it's just a little over two dollars for the both of you
uh two dollars each yah
so um
so i need to get two of those correct
you need to get three uh you need to get three uh to to use for your daughter as well and then you get your refund before you leave
so i have provided like ninety dollars for the three of you and you know you have some extra spare
ah alright
okay
right
um any you know um food places that you'd probably recommend we can check out before we go
that brings you to food places
yup
anything particular you have in mind
you stay at this hotel in chinatown
go to the maxwell food centre that's the cheapest place for food and the best value because you get authentic chinese food
do you like chinese food
oh i love it
and this place is a very old market that also has been restored
and the good thing is you can see food that is being sold
you can see in other words are you getting chicken or duck or fish
and the people there office workers when you go on a week day uh they will be happy to explain to you what they're eating if you need help
oh that's nice
so for your daughter maybe five dollars or even three dollars a plate of something a dollar juice uh if you like
soya bean a dollar as a dessert five dollars for her
and for your husband and yourself maybe seven or eight dollars each
not bad
so the food there is good huh
yes very good uh i eat there quite often
what's your favourite
uh there is a chicken rice store uh there are i think two stores there you just look for the one with the longest queue
it's you know uh she serves the best you know
it is she's very generous with the ingredients chicken and the rice
uh and if you do you know porridge rice porridge
yup
uh so that too
so don't order like five dollars just order the minimum and you'll get an idea of it
so the taste is also the best and the guidebooks for food have written up about her
anything else
what other food do you you know usually help yourself to
uh there is what we called uh teochew porridge
so it is rice porridge and there are sort of variety of dishes like steam fish fried fish uh salted egg vegetables different vegetables cooked in different ways tofu
so you pick what you want and you eat it
uh so it depends on what you pick fish uh a whole fish of course is more expensive if you are just taking a slice is less and if your taking vegetables usually it's a dollar or seventy cents a little plate
so because it's so cheap you can take a variety and the three of you can share
and so this is like close to where i'm gonna stay if ever
yes very close you can walk there
and you can even eat there every day you will not run out of stalls okay because have so many stalls there uh i think over a hundred
i see
yah i was just looking at the picture and i can see that i could probably you know i couldn't count the stalls there it's probably a very long lane of stalls right
but those are you mostly chinese food nothing
yes
uh there is there are also indian stalls selling something like uh uh fried pancake
you know prata it is a dough that is fried and we take it with chicken curry or fish curry or mutton curry
um but i'm not really a fan of curry
what about other food aside from indian food
european food maybe western food or thai food do you have thai food there
uh that there probably is but i cannot recall for sure
usually i think yes there is a thai there is what she call herself japanese but you know it's the cheaper type of japanese food there
so it's at the lower end
maybe you pay five dollars for rice and um uh piece of meat a sizeable piece of meat on your rice
and for thai food you will get your usual green mango you know
uh the sour and sweet mango uh and the pad thai you know pad thai
no i don't
the noodles it's very nice it's a very special thai dish
and uh even if you don't go to this market uh you can walk along the streets in chinatown and you will be able to find thai food you'll be able to find um malay food uh even our muslim restaurant
so if you want to try different cuisines just outside your hotel you can find
wow
you have like
we also have a food street there it's called smith street
you can take this down s m i t h street it's the food street of singapore
smith street okay
and what about the prices of the food there
about more or less the same
do you go there a lot too
yes i go there when i'm in chinatown i will always eat in chinatown
but because my place is quite near to chinatown uh you know i've been i eat quite often maxwell market especially
so can you see the pictures here
uh okay this one shows the food
okay just wait a while for it to load the picture
you see at night the road is closed off to traffic and the stalls are put out and the stall holders man their cooking just next to the tables
oh so it's just like a night market of some sort
yes but this is for food
for food yah
and in chinatown the night market is also a day market
oh i see
there
so on the next road to this is where they sell things that you can buy like souvenirs
this is smith street where you eat
and how far is that gonna be from the hotel
uh if you walk and you stop and look at shops maybe ten minutes otherwise i if you walk fast i think five minutes you can get there
alright that sounds good
so you can get your souvenirs cheap souvenirs uh if you need to buy like for twenty people or thirty people you don't want to spend a fortune
uh you can get things for one or two dollars um
really
yes but uh there would be things like you know chopsticks with uh
do you have pictures of that shop that you're just talking about
cause
uh it's actually along the street side
i don't think they have a website
it is uh a little stalls where they sell uh souvenirs like during the new year they sell we decorations for chinese new year
ah okay
what about bazaars do you have like bazaars there as well
this would be the closest to a bazaar
you want okay you want pictures of the shops let me see if i can get it for you
so how long have you been doing this jeanne
i've been doing it for more than twenty years
oh my goodness so you really must love it right
yes
when i first did chinatown we had a street side fortune tellers but they are gone now
i don't want to ask why
uh they are you know that we spruced up chinatown that's why if you're worried about anything all the buildings are very clean they have been conserved so they look uh new but in fact they are from the eighteen hundreds
wow
yah
can you see the picture of the stalls there
so here you see the lanterns decorating the street side for the lunar new year which is around february
and then it's quite crowded
could
but at this time that you uh you can also buy things along chinatown but you won't have to jostle with people it will be more comfortable for you
well that's nice to know i really don't like crowds at all
uh yes
so here you can see you can get your post cards
you
oh that's nice
can you see a little chinese costumes if i'm not mistaken for your uh daughter
and they are not too expensive are they
no no they are not expensive at all
in fact some of them when they hang big signs outside their stalls uh usually i don't bargain because they are already telling you that this is a bargain
i think i better get one of those
that's so nice
yes you can get one for yourself and for your daughter as well
i just might uh do that
a lot of tourists do that because they can wear their souvenir
right
food street market
okay
uh here you can see some uh i don't know if you're interested in these chinese uh artefacts
the little dragon there you can use it to decorate your home
i actually have one at home
oh you do okay
yah
they're actually nice in the home and they say that they bring i don't know luck or something
very colour ye yes
uh they during the chinese new year period before the chinese new year we get a lot of shop selling these decorations
i could just imagine
uh yes
hm that's nice
what are those things hanging there in the middle of the picture
this the brown things
yup
if i'm not mistaken this is a dried gourd g o u r d. it is a fruit like a melon that is dried up and when it's dried it hardens and they dig out the centre
and when it's thoroughly dried it is a container it's waterproof
so in in china they are used to keep chinese medicines even liquidised medicines inside these containers
so when you give this away to somebody it is uh a symbol of wishing him good health and longevity
so new year you can get them uh usually you'll give them to the older people
it's symbolic nobody would put medicine in them now we just buy it for fun
wow
but of course it's available even if it's not the new year correct
no it's available all the time
uh here we have something fancy we have the fans
okay these are the chops these are the fans
uh you might want to get one just to fan yourself when you're walking around and that if you take care of it it will last
can you see it's a dollar
okay
is that something that's made of paper or
paper
and hand painted no not really
uh i think it's printed
you can get th uh there is a calligrapher there in chinatown who will draw your write out your name in chinese uh then you'll have to pay him accordingly
uh he will look at your name and he will get the phonetic translation into chinese and try and give you a nice meaning and then he would uh give you a scroll with your name on it
you can hang that in your house too
wow that's so nice
maybe about ten dollars only i think
i better get one of that
you can bar that man is nice you can bargain with him
he did it for school kids at uh you know a few dollars just to amuse them
can you see at the back of the picture here these squares that are tilt over
uh that is paper cut outs in red paper
yah
i have some myself
uh this is a skill from the chinese uh are very good at
they fold paper up and then they cut it
and after they finish cutting they open up the paper and you've got this wonderful design uh
okay
and the designs were like abstract or are they supposed to represent something
uh usually abstract but not abstract in the sense that you can make out what it is you know
hm okay
that's interesting
do you make them
yah
oh no i can't make them i'm so i only buy such things
okay these are the chopsticks
wow colourful
uh if i'm not mistaken i once saw a chopsticks for children where they attached the two chopsticks together so she cannot lose the chopstick while she's eating
and she cannot drop it on the floor maybe you'll get one for your daughter
yah
training chopsticks or some sort
yes but the adults always buy this to train themselves
i might get one myself
oh you don't know how to use chopsticks
right
well i was just kidding
okay
we actually have um chopsticks at home and when i was little just for fun my brother and i would usually use chopsticks for eating just for the fun of it but it's been a while since i actually use one
what's that
it looks delicious
okay you're talking about the fish
yes you see the chinatown hawkers
that street i told about where you saw the pictures of all the stalls along the road decorated with the lanterns
you can get this dish
uh it's a special fish song he that the chinese like
they believe that it can cure them of um sickness and things like that
and here it's cooked
you can see the dish it's around fifteen dollars
yup
and you can tell them not to put chili if you don't want chili because here they cook it specially for you
maybe a little chili but not too much
yah little here the chili looks like a garnishing so i think it should be okay
not too hot right
yah
okay
do you like that
uh yes i'd like to eat that but i have to be very careful with the bones uh to you know
usually we don't eat when we we don't talk when we're eating this so we can concentrate
you will have to pick up the bones for your daughter
oh so it's a little bony
yah the way because it's near the heat to you'll scales you know that what's inside the mouth here and there but it's very yummy to eat
it's where you eat and you chat and you use your fingers
sounds like fun
okay
you can cross the street in chinatown safely
can you see this bridge
yup
it's a very wide bridge and when you cross over we have a shopping centre and shopping in fact shopping centres on both sides
oh that's nice
so you can categorised your shopping
up market you can go to marina bay sands and uh for lesser price items lower price items you can do your shopping in chinatown
alright
so i think i got everything that i need thank you so much jeanne
and i'm glad to be able to help you i hope you enjoy your stay and your daughter too
i think i will definitely enjoy my stay

okay
how are you eric
i'm doing good
how about you
i'm fine
how can i help you eric
yah
uh jeanne i was just calling in to um ask for your assistance
cause um i have a plan to visit singapore
um i still don't have any fix date but then i was looking in to going to singapore during the night race for the formula one
would you happen to know when uh one
oh that would be yes
formula one is in september
uh usually i think the third week of september
third week of september
uh who are you traveling with
um i'll be um
who are you traveling with
um i'll be all by myself
all by yourself just to watch formula one
yes
okay
yes
and i'm also looking into uh being there um during the qualifying race
okay
so it's uh the races would be friday saturday and sunday usually
so it's twenty first to twenty third of september
okay
and um i'm just looking into um i'm just looking for saturday and sunday
uh but then i don't have any plans of staying there for three days just for two days
two days means you wants only one night in singapore
uh yes
just um saturday and then uh sunday evening
and then maybe fly out uh back to the um back to the philippines um after the race
oh okay
so one night
yes
then you'll have lots of money for your ticket
uh you don't want to visit anywhere else in singapore
uh
um if it would still be possible if i had time because i'm not exactly sure about um the schedule for the qualifying race and then what time the actual race starts
but then if i have time in between the qualifying and uh what's the the qualifying race and then the um the night race itself then i pretty much can visit different areas in singapore
but then i'm not sure where to go cause

and save yourself for the race
okay
okay
let me see the sorry
you're gonna ask me something
yah um cause i only have a budget of one thousand singapore dollars
um wo is that good enough for the qualifying race alone or would it also cover the race itself
you can buy the ticket for the two days
for the two days
um how much is that
uh let me see
how much is that gonna cost
yah
the ticket price just a minute
okay
uh early bird tickets you can buy it would be a big cheaper if you are sure to be coming
okay
so you still qualify for the early bird race uh purchase
can you see
oh i'm afraid it's a minimum of four tickets
yah one to three tickets are thousand dollars
okay
uh wait let me see
you can buy at places that are not so premium for watching
okay
i think the grandstand would do
the bay grandstand
um yah
yes
the bay grandstand you get a view of the okay let me tell you the difference
the bay grandstand you get a view of the uh bay that has been turned into a reservoir
padang grandstand it is our old colonial district
you would be able to see maybe a longer stretch of them racing
and uh which area would be the starting line
starting line i'm not very sure where they start the race
let me try and find out for you
okay
uh but let me have a look at the tickets first huh
okay
no problem
okay
i think it's the waterfront grandstand if i'm not mistaken
i cannot remember exactly
but for your tickets uh if you buy one ticket at bay grandstand it's only about two hundred and fifty dollars
if you buy
and would that um that would be for the qualifying and for the night race itself
or just for the qualifying race
let me see
oh it doesn't three da it's a three-day ticket category
okay
sounds good
and you so you can actually come in one day earlier and watch all you know the yes three days
okay
maybe we can find out from here where they start uh the race
and um how does it work
um during the night race you close down the s uh you close your streets for the race itself
yes
we close our streets and we have lots of concerts
okay
so the race starts at the pit here
can you see
okay
so uh for the if i buy seats um in the pitt area uh in front of the pitt area that would be the one over a thousand dollars a thousand singaporean dollars
that's right
yes that's right
the one at the waterfront bay is here
and this is all the sea
and the race continues down and this is the padang
so there is another padang uh stand tickets
that's the one that is two hundred over dollars i believe
okay
and that
one that i told you two hundred and forty eight dollars
and that's a straight line as well
straight line yes
but you get a very good view of the drivers you know
if they are overtaking uh doing something rather dangerous you can see because some of the bends there are it's a bit dangerous for them
i don't think they overtake at those corners
okay
yah
okay
so would you suggest that there'd be more accident happening during straight lines rather than the
if i was a driver that's what i would do
i'm not sure what they would do um
okay
that i think that sounds good
um it's two hundred fifty something dollars right
yes
it's two hundred and forty eight
so you can say it's about two hundred and fifty dollars
okay
so um would that include the taxes or is it um the taxes aren't it's not part of the two fifty dollars
i'm not sure but the tax let me see huh the ticket prices let me go back to it
because this is uh billed through sistic
it should include i mean if they put in taxes it will be a odd figure with a few cents
okay
i think it includes
it does
because it there is no exclusion that taxes are not included
okay
and you also take um american express over um as payment right
all your credit cards uh would be acceptable
okay
um yah i think that the two hundred fifty um dollar ticket prices is good enough for me so that still leaves me with seven fifty
um so that i can go there if i have free time
i can you know go around singapore and possibly shop
oh yes
you'll have lots of money to shop because you're staying only one night
uh do you want to stay in a nice hotel in chinatown
um what would you suggest
uh let's say for two cause i would want as much as possible i would wanna have more money um more pocket money for shopping
more pocket money for shopping
then you would book a bed in a hostel
that's not very comfortable right for twenty dollars
you have a lot of money left over for shopping
uh or do you want to just have a room that is not so expensive
maybe around hundred dollars
yes
okay
um yah
i would wanna definitely wanna save a bit of money for shopping
um but then if i look at a place to stay and i would want it to be secure and safe
oh all our hostels are safe
even our backpackers joints are safe
they have been checked over
and usually you'll have lockers
you want a cheap safe accommodation is it
okay
okay
um yes
uh okay
uh and you don't mind if uh you have outside bathrooms and uh the places i've checked out before they on the pictures they look very clean
okay
um i would prefer to have my own bathroom inside the room
oh so you want to have your own bathroom
well even at the backpackers joints uh there are some a little bit better value in the sense that uh for those who want privacy let's see if we can find one for you here
okay
okay
and um it comes with an air conditioning unit
oh yes
if you are having a room definitely
and even the backpackers joints they have air conditioning
because here we are rather warm and humid
so air conditioning is like a must in hotels
okay
that sounds good
and if you are serious about coming i suggest you book the rooms straightaway because at that time uh the rooms run out very fast
okay
so just give us a moment
if you book now in fact i think you can get your room
uh the category that you want a little bit easier
and
and um
if you book
if i book in advance uh do i get a discount or would it still be the regular rate
uh it depends on the hotel
uh nowadays the hotels know that this is a peak period
so i don't think you'll get a discount
um in the regular hotels in fact you'll have to pay more like in the first class hotels uh they charge more
okay
okay
and um since this is my first time uh that i'll be in singapore um are there several precautions that um i should be aware of
let's say your laws in singapore that i should abide by
okay
do you want to see our rooms first
we are trying to uh find out
okay
sure
okay
let me see whether we can get a picture of this whether they have rooms for you because it says twenty eight dollars which would not be a room i think
but uh
okay
so twenty eight dollars a night
they have uh let's see if they have they usually show the lowest price
okay
uh okay
see they have oh no oh can you see that it's a mix dorm
can you see on your pre screen
yes
so that would be six-bed mix dorm
and uh it's thirty three dollars a night
alright
okay
um do you have anything that would be more than uh that's not gonna go over fifty dollars
but then it's a single room
single room for under fifty dollars i think that's a bit tough
uh that's a bit tough
yah
closer to a hundred dollars you might be able to get a room uh of your own
a room
okay
yah i think that's fine cause um i still have two hundred fifty dollars to spare for the ro for the hotel accommodation
oh so if you spent uh oh you mean if you s your ticket is two hundred and fifty dollars you have seven hundred and fifty dollars left
yah
cause i wa cause i plan how um to make use of five hundred dollars for the pocket money
and then the two hundred the two hundred fifty dollars for the um for the room accommodation for the hotel accommodation
that's wow
two hundred and fifty dollars will get you a hotel room
okay
uh okay
let me try and find one for you
uh but two hundred and fifty is actually a very great good great hotel
you don't really need two hundred and fifty dollars
okay
and for two hundred fifty dollars uh do i get two nights or just one night
in some hotels you would be able to get two nights
okay
so let's say less than a hundred dollars
let us try less than a hundred
so then you can stay two nights right
um yes
cause i plan to be there by sa maybe saturday morning
and then watch the qualifying race uh maybe the second qualifying race
okay
so okay this one little india is actually not less than a hundred
but this is a good hotel here
it's a hundred and fifty eight
can you see
yes
fortuna hotel
this is in little india
it's a good area
then we have budget class
uh the first two that states little india you are very near to town and you can get to your race very easily by the trains
okay
the ones that say geylang are too far away
okay
um i actually have a question
um what would you highly suggest
uh would you suggest that i buy a ticket for the f one race and then um get a separate hotel accommodation
or do i get a hotel accommodation that um that is very near the um uh what's this
the race line
oh if you do that you will bust your budget
uh because if you the hotel rates will go up during that time for the budget class hotels
so
so even though if i book in advance
let's say a few weeks from now
even though you book in advan no even though you book in advance
because the hotels know that it's a very popular period
and they also have to pay a small fee as a tax
uh so they bill it into the room rates
so i think your priority to is to book your hotel first and or tickets
then you have tide in your cost for your trip
you know the two important things for you and the rest of it you can use for shopping
okay
okay
so this is a good hotel
can you see uh the one that's hundred and fifty five dollars
uh santa grand hotel bugis
it's also just one stop away from the race venue
it's in a shopping area
it's also fairly new
i have uh passed by a few times
and looks uh quite good from the outside
okay
so this is a one-star hotel
uh one or two stars
yah we don't go by the star system in singapore because it's too restrictive on pricing
but maybe i would call it two-star
uh lavender street
let me see
okay
beach hotel you can also walk to the race area
hundred and thirty dollars
uh broadway hotel is in little india
you can take a train
that's a hundred dollars
you'll save some money
um would you suggest that the hotel i take uh be near um the racing venue or far from the racing venue wherein i would have i would still have to take the train
it's okay if you take just one stop
uh and in fact for one stop i think you can walk
i'm assuming you're quite young right
um yes
yes
so uh that's not a problem
it's if you would travel far then you waste time traveling
okay
and there are also maybe traffic jams and uh because there is road closure uh for where the races run
so traffic is diverted
so it would be a good walk
uh if you're on the beach road hotel you it's a very short walk
i mean i would walk it
i mean i suppose you could hop up a bus and take it for one stop
but uh there may not be buses there
if it's diverted it will affect the bus route also
so you might as well walk
okay
yah
i believe it is um if it includes a short walk that would be fine
so i can enjoy the scenery as well
yes
that's right
so you can take the uh beach hotel then you walk
or you can take uh broadway hotel that's in little india
it's quite interesting uh because well if you don't go anywhere you just walk around the area
uh lots of things to see hindu temples
uh are you bringing your camera
um yes
yes i am
so you can in the early morning uh when you are not involved in the watching the races you can uh take photographs of the uh people going there to shop the people praying in the hindu temples the flower garland makers
so you can do you know things that tourist normally do
you'll get a lots of souvenir photographs when you go home
okay
okay
yah
i think i think that's a
what we had
that i believe that's a uh it sounds like a really good deal
um just another question with the hotel reservation
does it come with free breakfast
uh some of them do some of them don't
but in this area at broadway hotel it doesn't really matter because all around you are cafes and uh also restaurants
you can eat at the little cafes
they are like coffee shops
and if you're vegetarian lots of vegetarian food
if you want some do you eat indian food
okay
and um yes i do
uh so you can get north indian which is less spicy
you can get south indian if you like your curries hot
you can have vegetarian and it would be just a few dollars
okay
so under five dollars for a good meal
yes
i think under five dollars would be more than enough
if you pay for the breakfast in the hotel i believe they would cost
it's gonna cost me more
they would cost you in a higher cost you more and then they put in a buffet spread you know jam and eggs and ham and you know the stuff that uh hotels normally provide
okay
okay
so i think i'm gonna enjoy singapore if i eat outside of the hotel
so yes you will
so here
let me see was it hun did it say a hundred dollars hundred and forty here it says
so single without breakfast right up to december is a hundred and forty dollars
december of this year
yes
so i think they don't provide breakfast here
okay
so the hundred and forty dollars that's only good for one night
yes for one night
okay
cause i think i'll be needing two days
that's right
if you have two days then you uh little bit more relax you know
after you have landed and you have a bit more time to sightsee
so two fifty for the tickets another two hundred and eighty for your two nights right
yah
um yes
so you have four hundred and seventy dollars left to spend
okay
and um where would four hundred eighty dollars get me um for shopping in singapore
is that good enough uh is that a good enough money or
if you what are you looking for in shopping
i'm not exactly sure what i'm gonna get
um but then what i've heard is that um the electronics or the gadgets in singapore its price significantly lower in comparison to the other asian markets
i don't have prices for the items
but there's a centre i will recommend you to
it's uh an it centre
so they have laptops they have the peripherals
and what i normally advice people to do is to go around the stores
be honest and tell them you are checking prices and you'll come back if they are giving you a good deal
okay
and um is there also flea market in singapore
yes
uh in fact if you ask me i think little india looks like a flea market with all the stalls filling out into the street
but you can go to a place called bugis where we have a little lane and there are lots of little stalls selling very low priced um souvenirs
okay
okay
and what would you suggest um would be a good souvenir to buy let's say when i get back
uh one of the souvenirs that should people normally buy is of the merlion uh sort of uh just an ornament to put on the table
and how much do they usually cost
uh depends on the size of the item
they have them really small for people who want tiny things
and they have them bigger and it depends on you know what it is made of
so if you go to a good class store it might cost you fifteen twenty dollars
if you buy it on the street side i think would be two three dollars you should be able to get it
it's not expensive
okay
that's good
and um
now here you ca
yah go ahead
sorry
so here is an air conditioned area uh within a shopping mall that is next to a hotel in the same district of bugis
and what we've done is we've conserved the old buildings
can you see the windows here
yes
on the right side
so is that a um is this is that a food market
uh no this is well there is food all around
but here it seems to be having a food fair
so that i think that was when it was photographed
but generally they have stalls selling a whole lot of things
if you want to buy uh scarfs for your girlfriend you want to buy handbags or you want to buy uh like you say souvenirs
you can get them here
so if you think it's too hot and you want somewhere air conditioned you can shop in here
okay
okay
but just opposite is the lane where you uh have shops on your left and right
and you have a whole range of items from uh t-shirts that young people like to wear uh and uh even buddha statues uh cd's even at times
and this is some of the food you can eat
okay
and what singapore uh what is singapore's um food delicacy
um is it chinese
is it indian
is it something else different
or what would you suggest that i eat uh that would make a big difference or that would make me remember singapore for their food
well do you like curry
or you prefer something that is not so hot
um i would wanna try something very different um that is uh none western in nature
i would want it to be something that is authentic of singapore
okay
okay
here can you see the stall here on your left
that's a peking duck right
can you see the ch no that's chicken
very fat chicken
and right at the end of the brown bird you can see a pale white one
oh okay
okay
uh at these stalls you usually can get two kinds uh roasted or you can get it a normal chicken rice
uh the chicken is boiled with pandan
do you know pandan leaves that are fragrance
um yes
and so uh the chicken is boiled and then the soup that is used to boil the chicken is used to cook the rice
and in the rice they tie up pandan leaves to give the rice fragrance
and they add a little bit of oil so the rice in itself in fact when i was a child i used to eat a lot of just the rice
we pour thick black sauce over it
and if you like to have it hot then you take a vinegarish chili
the chili is ground with um a little bit of vinegar sauce
but if you don't like that's optional
and the chicken is very delicious
okay
okay
okay
so it's more of
you can also eat
okay
so it's more of the broth of the chicken uh that's the same thing that you use for cooking the rice is that it
uh yes
yes
and then you get a soup
the soup comes free of charge
okay
and how much would that cost
is it would it be a cup of rice or is it just how like how many servings
uh sometimes they have a fix deal three dollars a plate
uh sometimes it's two dollars
but i think two dollars will not be enough for you
and also the cuts of meat you know
if you want to have the thigh of the chicken which is very popular maybe you have to pay three fifty
and some places yah at fifty cents per rice
so if you like the rice and you say i want another bowl of rice.
they will charge you another fifty cents
okay
okay
so that's one delicacy that i can try out maybe when i get there
yes
that is something that's a favourite with locals and with tourist as well
okay
and what else would you suggest
um something else authentic or something authentic or different
some okay
something that's very nice uh that uh we like and tourist like and the restaurants are the food vendors are very good at
um sometimes you know if you tell them i don't want it so hot.
they will make it with a little bit less chili
okay
and would you suggest i eat from a restaurant or from the side street vendors
if you want to save money for shopping then you go for the side street vendors
if you want to have uh to pamper yourself then you can eat at the restaurants
uh the dish i am recommending is chili crab
okay
okay
okay
and this is something that's only available in the restaurant or do they also sell this in the side street
uh so usually at the restaurants
uh normally this meal you share it with friends because it's finger licking good
and as you break up the crab they give you something to they've smashed the crab a little bit so that you can get at the meat inside uh the shell
but then uh there are parts of it you can't reach so they give you a little fork to dig in
and then you uh buns
can you see here at the description
okay
yes
served with steam deep fried buns
these are very nice and soft buns uh with nothing inside
so you dip this bun into the gravy
okay
so um what's that
mantau
is it mantau or mantou
yes
that's right
it's mantou that is uh usually served in chinese food
when i was young we uh just add it with plain white bread
so what if you order this i suggest you just order this and don't order anything else
so you can eat the whole crab
okay
okay
so the okay
so um and the mantou is the one that they use for the dumplings right
uh yes
but this is a mantou with just a slice
and then it's empty
it's empty inside
so the idea is that instead of eating rice you use the mantou to wipe out the sauce and eat that
that would be your carbohydrate
the bread
okay
it's a sweet
uh not so sweet
it's chili with uh sweet sauce so that the sweetness balances the chili
okay
and how much does this cost
it goes by the crab
so it varies with the price of the crab
it could be maybe i would say not more than forty dollars
wow
that's expensive
a whole crab yah
uh maybe thirty i'm estimating on the highest side in case the price of the crab goes up at the time
uh the thing is they sell it by the crab and they will weigh the crab
so it's alright if you go and ask how much they weight and you can walk away and say no i don't want to take you know
and um that wouldn't be impolite right
no uh i do it all the time
if i too expensive i tell them no uh yah
but uh as i said this dish is very nice if you have a few people to share
then you order things like vegetables
and let me see what do we have here
i can't recognise this dish
let's have a look at this
oh this is
clams
uh yah
clams steamed and they have mixed garlic
and it's a light dish
so this uh clams they actually looked like bamboo
that's why they're called bamboo clams
okay
and this is also priced at forty dollars or lower
no would this would be much less
maybe twelve fifteen
it varies with the restaurants
uh the jumbo is a very popular restaurant and it's got a few branches
they have one restaurant which is very near to the f one uh race track
okay
okay
okay
it's along the river
and so it's very convenient for you
okay
um do they raise their prices during race day
or is it um do they have a fixed amount for the food
no i don't think they raise their prices
uh they only li raise prices uh for some restaurants during the lunar new year
uh but if they raise prices it would be you know on the menu or they would be assigned to tell you
they wouldn't suddenly give you a bill you know that is higher than what's on the menu
that's good
so you can see can you see a view of the restaurant
it's a nice place
um yes
um is that a river
yes
that is the river which is right next to the f one uh race track
okay
and it opens out into the marina bay which is now our reservoir
uh which collects rainwater that falls in the city
so you know the ambiance is very nice
okay
you just have to look at the menu before you order and ask them to weigh the crab
okay
and that you don't have to eat the crab if you don't like
you can have steamed prawns
you can have a fish
uh generally in singapore the fish and crabs and prawns uh would be the higher price items
if you are vegetarian it's much cheaper to eat
okay
okay
um i just have another question
um if i go to singapore would i enjoy the food if i eat in the restaurant or would i get a better taste of singapore if i take my food and buy it from the street vendors
if you buy it from the street vendors uh you are getting more singaporean taste
you know what i mean
um you are getting what i would be eating without busting my budget
if you go into the restaurants you are getting sometimes it is modified to the taste of the tourist
that means the chili maybe a little bit left out
uh if you are buying off the street you can ask them
you well you can ask them to reduce the chili
when they can they will reduce it for you
but otherwise for two dollars or three dollars they will give you what they have
and you know uh it would be maybe a little bit more adventurous
okay
hm okay
that's good
the vendors in little india are very accommodating
they're very friendly
so i eat there quite often
and you would obviously look like a tourist
so they would be happy to accommodate you
okay
uh that sounds really good
and um is i just wanna get a bigger picture
would four hundred dollars go along way for two days in singapore
four hundred dollars to spend
yes
for
uh or to shop
to spend that's a lot of money
i don't spend that much in a week
uh it's
okay
or even two days right
yah
no that's a lot of money in singapore
hm okay
so four hundred dollars
that's good enough for food and then for shopping
yes for food
you can even eat your crab
uh you will still have money left over
and you can eat street food also
you don't want to blow it all on restaurants right
so in little india if you eat in the little cafes uh it will cost you uh ten dollars if you order more than one dish
ten dollars
if you will order yah
if you walk in uh there's a little indian restaurant opposite a hindu temple
the road is called veerasamy road
i don't think they are on the internet
but they will have different uh vegetarian like pancakes cooked with unions uh cooked with potatoes inside
they're just between one dollar and maybe two fifty
that's all
okay
so it's not expensive
and uh does singapore also provide or serve ethnic food
ethnic food would be the food you get in little india
in chinatown would be the chinese food
okay
but then is there something that is um something that would really describe yah the food in singapore or let's say um it's singaporean brand type of food
is there something like that
chicken rice and chili crab are very singaporean because we uh supposed to have adopted the chicken rice from china but we have revolutionalised it so it's totally our own brand
and the chili crab also
um during chinese new year we have another one
it's called yusheng that we tossup
it's a salad that we eat
and that's also singaporean
but that's normally you get it when you come before the lunar new year
okay
so uh they don't serve that kind of salad on let's say during september or maybe this month
no they serving that
because it's superstitious when we eat that as we add the ingredients and we toss it up
we say auspicious things in chinese to bring us wealth good health lots of grandchildren and things like that
okay
maybe i can what's this
i can come back to singapore and just come back to singapore and try out that salad
yes
it's very nice
uh you've got to come before the new year because during the chinese new year some of the restaurants maybe closed for the first day or the second day to give their staff a break
and that's uh in february
uh you have to check the chinese calendar
so it changes because it's not a gregorian calendar
okay
very interesting
and um what else would you suggest that i do um aside from the f one race and then trying out the singaporean delicacies
okay
you want to
is there anything else that i can do
let's say if
you wanted to uh buy some uh computer peripherals
is that right
you were mentioned it just now
um yes
but that's also one thing that i'm considering
but then is there anything else that i can do to make my first trip to singapore memorable
okay
uh we have wait
let me show you funan centre first
and funan centre is is this a mall
it's yes
it's a mall
it's uh when it's open it's dedicated to computer items
information technology shops
and can you see city hall there
so it's just next door to city hall
okay
and would your what's this
would your sub courts and your what's this
your supreme court also be in the city hall or is it in a different place
it is in the area but uh city hall and the supreme court right now they are molded up uh for the uh they are no longer functioning as uh court or government officers but they are gonna be turn into one big uh museum and art gallery
so you know uh it's not there for you to photograph
it wouldn't look so nice
okay
but um is that a restricted area for tourist to take photographs of
no not restricted
and the actual court is just behind it
so if you look at the padang
can you see connaught drive
sort of where the word singapore is
yes
uh if you are booking your tickets you'll be sitting right here opposite connaught drive
okay
and behind it would be funan mall
so your computer shops are there
and then if you have time at night you can walk along uh the river
can you see boat quay
you can see you a little blue curvy line
that's our historic river
okay
and um where is jumbo located
the jumbo restaurant
is it along side boat quay
and there are okay
yes so do you see boat quay
yes so do you see boat quay
it's on the opposite banks of uh the hill street area where the road name is shown
so can you see uh merchant road
so before merchant road it's right along the river
it's along there
if you walk along it you cannot miss it
so um would you consider that a short walk or is it a long walk
it's a short walk
i walk much more than that every time i'm in the area
okay
um is that a five-minute or ten-minute walk
if you walk fast just five minutes
otherwise if you are looking at things which i presume you will be doing maybe ten minutes
okay
that's good
there is also an interesting museum just behind um where you see the boat quay name
can you see
so across the river from there is the asian civilisation's museum
and you can visit that too
the
then that would be the one that they commercialise or they show in the history channel
oh i don't know about the history channel
uh this museum shows you the early history of singapore in the front foyer
i'm sorry
and uh
um it was is that the old british office
yes that's right
that's the old british office that used to be a government office
okay
okay
that's good
let me get it for you
and can tour um would i be allowed as a tourist to take photographs of the museum
uh not inside the exhibits there
because uh i think one is for security reasons and sometimes people forget to switch off their flash and you would fade the exhibits
and they have you know old fabrics and uh artifacts that would suffer from too much light
so for some of the exhibits it's actually a little bit dim
okay
so we have an exhibit on south asia that would be india
we have one there you see some of the statues that we have on display
okay
so i can definitely take pictures as long as i turn off the flash
yes but you check with the security before you enter uh just to be sure yah
um we have an southeast asian exhibit
uh this is my favourite
it's west asia
it's a room where you find out about uh the islamic culture and they have got old calligraphy uh small little e korans you know the holly book for the muslims with hand drawn calligraphy
okay
if you like you can also visit this museum the peranakan museum which is also nearby
and would i have to pay an entrance fee
or can i enter the museum without paying anything
uh for the asian civilisation's museum the outside area that shows you the singapore history and the history of the river that one that one is uh free of charge
so if you go too late and you think you have no time uh then i suggest you go to visit just the outside area and you can take photographs from there into the river
so you get a good view
okay
okay
okay
can you see this picture here
um yes
uh so let me see huh
so the acm is here
your um seats for watching the f one is where the cricket club is just around the corner
okay
so walking distance and your uh rice chicken uh sorry your chili crab is down boat quay just a little bit further down
let me see if i can get the prices for you
i know it's ten dollars only
ten dollars for the museum entrance
yes
it shouldn't be more than ten dollars in fact eight dollars
okay
well that's really that's an affordable price
okay
very affordable
and you may even get it free that's talk about allowing you free entry to the museums
and uh do they also sell souvenirs in the museum
yes
there is a museum shop but uh the souvenirs are very good quality
so they are not low price
hm okay
uh although they do have certain items on sale now and then
okay
that's good
i think souvenirs you get from chinatown and little india you would save money
uh and then you can buy your computer it products from funan centre
okay
sounds really good
four hundred dollars is a lot of money
you can eat your chili crab
okay
i definitely consider that
so i can eat the chili crab
i just wanna make sure that i get everything correct
so there's a chili crab there's a chicken rice
yes uh
and then i can also eat curry in the indian um uh what's this
in the what do you call that
the indian city
yes
uh the indian restaurants there um in little india
okay
and my hotel is near uh it's a walk it's walking distance from the race venue and the race venue is also near the museum
and the restaurant for the chili crab is also walking distance
so
the if you take the beach road the hotel that was located at beach road that one is walking distance
if you take the one
and that's a hundred and forty dollars
yes
if you take the one in little india you have to take a train
unless you don't mind walking a little bit more
okay
i wouldn't mind
i definitely enjoy singapore walking
yes
do you want to see a map of the uh train
the so
um yes
i would definitely appreciate it
cause i think i haven't shown you that right
um yes
yah
i haven't seen it yet
and your mrt map uh what is your mrt
how does one train ride cost
it goes by distance
so it depends on how far you travel
and from what you have planned it's not very far
so uh maybe the longest distance would be from the airport to the city
so you get your ticket from the basement of changi airport
can you see on the right side of your map
okay
okay
hm changi
okay
yah
okay that's station number three
you take it to tanah merah
and you have to get off and switch on a train that goes westwards
okay
and when you go down westwards you travel down
if you are going to book into the hotel in little india you switch you i think you go all the way down to outram park that would be easier
and then you get off and get on what we call the north east line which is purple
okay
okay
can you see the purple line
um yes
so that's outram park very near to chinatown
you turn north east
there are hotels also in chinatown but you can carry on to little india
and that's only one two three four stops
that would be maybe your most expensive ride hm under three dollars singapore money
okay
that's very affordable
yes
and the rest of your rides would be from little india uh down to if you want to go to chinatown it's two stops
you can also stop at clarke quay which is uh
that's the river
yah it's the river
is that the river
okay
yes
and you could walk from clarke quay uh to the f one sites
uh and also to where you eat
okay
and the marina bay is also part of the racing line
yes
you see the bay
so when you take photographs you have the bay in your background
um and when you walk around you can see the marina bay sands which is one of our two um integrated resorts
beautiful view for the background
if you uh don't want to get off at clarke quay you can also go to city hall from dhoby ghaut
can you see
you switch to city hall station
and that's also in the area
uh city hall is maybe a little bit nearer two minutes nearer to where you would be seated for your show
for your well i call it a show for the f one race
okay
and um your mrt system is it a subway or is it an elevated type of mrt system
it's a mix
it's part of it is above ground
when you come down from the airport you get a good view until kallang yes
and then it goes underground because that area is built-up
and in the chinatown area it is all uh built-up so it is underground
but when you go out of the city it is above ground for some parts
uh the purple line is mostly underground
okay
and this mr syste mrt system that you're showing me it covers entire singapore
almost all of singapore
but it's also integrated with a bus system
so for example uh at paya lebar where you have an interchange there are lots of buses there to cover areas not covered by the mrt
at dhoby ghaut there are lots of buses as well and at city hall
we also have a bus information board behind where you sit you can read off and find information
where about you know where the buses would bring you to
okay
okay
and your bus system also has uh does it follow a strict schedule
it follows a strict schedule but we can't control the traffic
so the traffic if there is a build-up of traffic then there would be a delay
hm sometimes we grumble because the same bus number comes two of the buses come together
but it's not the fault of the driver or the scheduler
it's because of the traffic
okay
okay
and what's this
uh your bus system and your mrt system is it a twenty four hour transportation system or are there is there a schedule for both of them
no that it's not twenty four hours
uh past midnight
for the f one they would be extended for sure
uh they would publicize it that they would extend it maybe for an hour or two
because they know a lot of people need to get home and so they need to provide the uh transportation
we also have a night rider system where the buses bring people from areas like uh chinatown uh the night clubbing areas back into the major cities
this is more to service singaporeans who have a night out and you know they don't drive
they can get home near enough to their homes
okay
okay
and is there a place in singapore that um uh i should avoid visiting tha that's un uh that's considered an unsafe area
the uh unsafe area
i really cannot think of any unsafe area as long as you don't um you know wear jewelry like gold chain and gold uh you know some people some men like to wear gold bracelets you know that are solid gold and cost thousands of dollars now
so if you do that you probably might invite trouble
uh one place that's a bit shady is called geylang
but to me it's very colourful
i have been there
it's uh we have some let me see if i can get you pictures there
it is a little bit out of the way
uh you get authentic food there
you can also can you see on your screen
okay
yes
um jeanne
um what uh what's this
i just wanna thank you for you know for enlightening me with um the places that i could visit in singapore
and i believe uh i have all the everything that i ha everything that i need for my trip this is this september
okay
uh i hope you will come and remember to buy your tickets early so that you can uh enjoy the cheaper rate for the hotel before it gets filled up
yes
i will keep that in mind
okay
yah
well thank you very much for your time
i appreciate it
alright
you don't want to wait for the picture of geylang
no
okay
alright then
goodbye
yah that's fine
yah thank you very much
okay
have a good day
goodbye
thank you
yah
thank you
bye
goodbye
bye
bye eric
bye
bye
hello
hello
hello good morning or good afternoon
this is jeanne
guide number two
hi
hi good morning ms. jeanne
this is maggie
i'm participant number twenty-eight
how are you maggie
i'm doing great and how about you
i'm fine too
how can i help you maggie
uh yah
i've actually uh planning a trip uh to singapore soon
uh some time in april
and um uh it's just going to be me my boyfriend and i'm going to carry like a small dog with me
uh i can't live anywhere without it
so i wanna know how that's going to be possible
you want to bring your dog
d o g dog
did you say
yes
i'm afraid you can't do that because your dog will have to be quarantined
oh i see
yes
so um if you bring it in your dog will still not be with you
he will be put in quarantine
you cannot carry your dog with you in the hotel and bring it into singapore
oh that's sad
so i have to find someone else to babysit my baby
yes
you have to find someone to babysit
okay
well okay i'm not sure
i don't think there'll be a problem um well cause me and my boyfriend are planning to go there around mid-april
uh whatever is available
and we planned to stay there for a week
so um i have really
one
i have re yes
one week
uh what is your uh intention
you want to have a room or are you willing to go backpacker style
so you want to save money for shopping
well okay
that i think we've been discussing
uh he is my boyfriend is on the uh cheap side
yah
but uh i wanna make sure that we're both comfortable
um as long as the room has everything we need air-conditioned
uh we're not going to carry much stuff
because uh we planned to go around
and you know savour all the delicacies that singapore has to offer
for wha okay
okay
so you want backpacker but you want to have a room
or rather the lowest priced rooms that you can get
is that it
um well not too low though
um i like a bit of luxury
oh you like a bit of luxury
we will look for it and see whether we can uh accommodate you
but how much money are you going to spend
um okay
uh i have about a thousand uh singapore dollars that i as my budget
is that for yourself
is your boyfriend sharing uh like he's gonna put in another thousand
um well cause i'm not sure about ho you know how the rate is over there
and uh how much we're going to need for you know to visit all the sightseeing go around eating
possibly um go on tours
well uh tours you can do yourself
let me see if i can get you uh rooms
uh okay
because you really you don't want dormitory
you also want to have uh a room right
so
yes
uh with a tv a hot shower and service room service
okay uh hm
yap
oh so that's not really backpacker right
that would be a hotel
uh not a very high price hotel
yah
yah
something that's uh you know affordable by middle class families
okay
let me see
so like aside from just the food in singapore
what else is there any to
what is your interest
um well i like uh um animals pretty much
um i like you know i wanna see all kinds of animals that you don't get to see in the states.
um i like you know i wanna see all kinds of animals that you don't get to see in the states.
okay animals
uh anything else
um aside from food
i also like you know uh a lot of uh beaches
uh theme parks if there're any
and uh going to nightclubs where there is a band
yap
okay
oh and yes and shopping is a must
oh yes of course
then there are lots of shops all over singapore
okay
here are some hotels here
yah uh hm
we have to look at your budget
alright
le let's look at under a hundred
well at what is shown here this one at eighty-five
it's a bit high price
i mean sorry
it's a bit low price but it's uh bit out of the way
yah bu out of the way like is it somewhere what do you mean out of the way
uh it is in what some of us considered a little shady part of singapore
full of colour actually
i think with your boyfriend it should be okay
but you have to walk a little distance to where the trains are
uh if you're in town this is a bit better
okay
well it would be great if it's close to where you know there are places to eat
so we don't have to walk so far
yes uh
now you if you look at the screen there are hotels
in chinatown
the keong saik hotel at ninety dollars
okay
and we also have in little india asphodel inn
uh race course road is uh in little india and it's eighty dollars
so what is your preference to be
in an area where you can get out and get chinese food
or where you can get indian food easily
oh that's something i have to talk with about my you know to talk about with my boyfriend
cause he is a big fan of chinese food but i like both
and i also like indian food a lot more than i do chinese food
so is there anything else that's in between
uh if you stay in chinatown
you are closer to places like uh museums
and some of the train stations
and you can also get indian food in chinatown
and it's only a short distance
two to three stops through little india
where you can choose from a whole variety of indian food
well so it sounds like that uh hotel near the chinese restaurant is the winner
yes that's right
keong saik street
uh ninety dollars is actually a very good deal
because it's right in town
uh and it is near the civic district which is our historic area and near the river
yes
so very easy
yah
that sounds pretty great
uh do you know what kind of uh amenities that the hotel offers
okay
let's have a look here
so is can you see
it's
yes i can
uh hm
okay
so they have a bar there
alright they have laundry
and uh air-conditioned rooms uh mini bars telephone shower internet access
alright
uh is that like uh free wi-fi
wi-fi
it doesn't say wi-fi right
do i see wi-fi
no and that something i'm alright that something i have to enquire with the hotel
no i don't se
alright so it doesn't sa
we have internet access here
can you see
yap
in your room
i ca oh in the room itself
okay
alright
not bad
that isn't that for ninety dollars per night
it's very good
can you see it won in a ha architectural heritage award
that sounds like a big deal
they did win an award
yes that that means the building is a pretty building
okay
yah it does look like
uh from the picture that i saw
okay just a minute
i'm trying to get you a bigger picture of it
yah this is the picture
okay
oh looks like cute
it's in a conservation area
and the buildings were totally renovated
so they would maybe late eighteen hundreds or early nineteen hundreds
i'm not very clear on the exact date
but they have been totally refurbished and redone
so they got an award because they have done it sensibly
wow
so you are in uh one of my favourite districts with all these history around you
and yet you have clean rooms
you have uh the convenience of uh shopping just outside
food
yah
it looks very nice and wow
so i will
show you where it is
yah
that would be great
so like how far is it from the airport
okay
i will show you on the map in a little while
there is a stop on the trains
but you will have to change trains
which i think is not a problem for you
right
yap
oh okay
so i have to take
is it like uh subway or is it um one of those uh skyway trains
uh it is as our system is known as mass rapid transit
and it is uh a mixture of above ground and below ground
alright
okay so that little uh inn is where the hotel is
yes
and there is uh two stops that will bring you near here
one is the outram park
the other one is on the other side and it's called chinatown
so you can just walk to where your hotel is
it's on uh slightly quieter part of chinatown
there are other hostels in the other side lanes
uh hm
where we have food stalls and souvenir shops
so this is a nice lane
uh that used to be a red light district but no more
in my grandfather's time it was
okay
okay
that i would have been worried if it was a red light district
because i bring my boyfriend
no it s not a red light district at all
okay
so they pretty much made it uh a tourist spot or upscale place
uh not really only for tourist
for locals as well
it's just the hotels are aim at the tourist
uh but the food and the uh i mean singaporeans visit the place
you will know when you visit there
you'll see a lot of locals shopping eating
so uh you soak in the atmosphere
okay
so uh if it is in if it is in uh area of chinatown i got do i have to communicate
they will bring a translator or something to speak to them
or do all them understand english
they would understand english
if you speak slowly
um hm okay
and if you are negotiating prices
what i do when i visit uh some other countries is that i bring a calculator
and i key in the amount i want to pay for whatever i'm buying
oh i see alright
so you will just show the price instead of saying it to them
yes
and so that's because you don't want them to misunderstand you
okay
i see
alright would then make sense
but most of the shopkeepers and the people who sell things along the roadside they understand basic english
so it should not be a problem
you may have problem understanding them
because we speak singlish
we combined english with chinese grammar
wait
what's it called again
it's uh singlish
that's an interesting term
singlish
yes
singapore english
i wonder when i heard it i was thinking okay
it sounds like they're singing english
okay
no singlish uh
that's pretty cool
the yes uh uh
uh so if you can't understand them just ask them to repeat what they are saying
oh but do all them sounds like you
i mean yah you speak english pretty well
uh yes uh but if i went to chinatown
i sort of naturally speak singlish a little bit
uh because i adopt what people are telling me
so uh singlish for example why you're so like that
do you understand me
oh wait i heard i heard i heard someone say that before
cause
i think there was a song about that
uh with the same words
yes
we had uh singer composer who is very popular
who composed songs and music with using singlish
that's interesting
i should look for that
uh occasionally we've got malay words thrown in
but uh it is very local
oh okay
cool alright
oh anyway um i just realised cause i was looking at the dates that i was planning to trip for
and um apparently there is a conflict
um boyfriend just texted me and he says we can only go for about one or two days
that's quite a short tour
so
uh that will leave you a lot of money for shopping if you just you see if you spend two days ninety dollars you can spend two days right
then yah
exactly not bad
but it's still such a short trip
so huh
yes it's a hundred and eighty dollars
yes it's a hundred and eighty dollars
so you said you wanted animals
so
um yes
there is there like a zoo or uh some sort of uh a farm
yes
can i get you singapore wildlife safari or singapore wildlife reserves
oh is there a difference
can you tell me the difference between the two what they offer
the reserves is the uh governing body for the bird park the zoo and the night safari
and the zoo and night safari are next to each other
so i suggest you buy a ticket for all three attractions
and you could visit all three in a day or you could do two on one day
and spend a morning at the bird park and you have the afternoon free
wow
so how far is that from the hotel
uh when i get back to the screen i'll show you
it's on the west line and you'll just have to connect
and take a short bus ride there
okay
okay
so here you're seeing a free-flight aviary within the jurong bird park which is part of the wildlife reserves
okay
oh sounds like an awesome place
yes
uh very good for photography
well cause my boyfriend is more interested at like interacting with the animals rather than taking pictures with them
oh you can see the show and you can when you enter you just get a leaflet
or if they have uh more specific brochure on the timings
if there is none printed out you just ask the girl at ticketing
the guest relation officers will advise you uh when are the feeding times
oh wow
okay
but-- so where you saw the birds feeding just now
yes
they usually put out bird food and fruits
very near to the pathway where you are walking
oh are we allowed to like go near the birds and feed them in some way
at feeding time if the keeper is there he will uh you can buy let's say of just a few dollars for the bird feed
and you can either hold it up in your little plastic container
or if you are brave you put the seed on your hand and they will feed of your hand
uh that would be great
it just an it sounds like a great thing a package
so um like uh what are the prices for you know if it's like a whole day thing
or um do we just have to pay upon entrance and then we have to pay for other attractions within that area
yes
uh can i show you the other attractions first and then i come to the pricing
sure
so this is the bird park
so this is at a different location from where the zoo and the night safari are located
uh because the zoo and night safari are just next door to each other
so if we look at the zoo
so that would be convenient
yes so i suggest to
yes so i suggest to because the night safari opens at seven
so you visit the zoo in the afternoon and the night safari in the evening
the same day
so you just walk across
okay
wow
what is that
that's uh a new nudist
uh it is a mole rat
uh a mole rat
wha
yes
and it doesn't have any hair
so that's why they called it a nudist uh colony
uh that looks quite scary
it's the first time ever i've seen a mole a naked mole rat
wow
yes
but uh they will not be in your face you know
um it's optional whether uh in fact i don't think you will be able to handle the mole rats
um of course not
uh any kind of wildlife uh shouldn't be touch their you know
it's great to see them from afar but obviously we should
uh you uh at the night safari yea i'm gonna show you now
there is a show and you can after the show they'll bring out some of the animals
if you like to handle a snake
well that might be an opportunity for you
oh so we're allowed to handle the snakes
like
uh only the ones that come out with the keepers
you we won't let you introduce snake enclosure
um but they'll be able to find you after that
okay
okay my boyfriend has a fear of snakes and uh i like them
so um and i want him with me
i don't think he wanna go with a you know a pit full snakes
that would just wouldn't make sense
uh in the zoo that i showed you just now we have uh reptile enclosure that you can go in
but i think you leave your boyfriend outside
so you
yah
okay yah he can just watch from afar
okay yah he can just watch from afar
uh you can see the giraffes here
we just had a new baby born
and
that is cute
so here we have the uh there is a tram ride and there's also uh walking trail
so if you walk fast and you are not too tired out you can take the tram ride
and after that do the walking trail
okay just uh maybe an hour if you walk slowly
because you say you like animals that would be fun right
yah
uh do we get like some sort of um uh interaction like with the snakes
do we get interaction with any of the uh safari animals
safari animals like i said after the show they bring them out and you can handle them have your boyfriend take photos with you
uh the interaction in the daytime in the day zoo so it's when you go for first with the orangutans
and that means you would go for the zoo visit for a whole day
you would stay for morning till afternoon
unless you take a break and journey to the bird park and comeback for the night safari
because at the breakfast time you have your breakfast the orangutans have their breakfast and then uh can go up and take photos with the orangutans
oh i see uh that would yah that sounds like a good plan
like um so we fill up the whole day and don't have to waste any of it
uh on the other hand um during the showtime also at the zoo
you can opt to buy food and feed the animals
where can we buy the food for the animals
eh uh in the same place
the the keepers will be there with the food
so it is actually managed by the keepers
so they want to keep it under control
they can't actually take out the cookies and feed the animals
oh yah
oh no that won't make that we might bring in something that they shouldn't be eating
yah
that's right
so do you want to know the ticket prices
oh yes please
uh wait
let me show you the opening hours and the rates um. so night safari
this is the leopard cat
you are only allowed in after dark
those are anteaters
they are really beautiful
can you see seven-thirty to twelve
why is it the night safari and not the daytime safari
so you
is there a reason
uh beca the daytime is what we called the singapore zoo
and so there is a price saving
can you see here thirty-two dollars admission and tram
yap
okay so thirty-two singapore dollars for each person
and includes
uh just a minute
have a look at this chart here
yah
can you see at the bottom night safari and zoo
it's only forty-two dollars
so you get a big discount
yah
that'll would be that's not bad
i would consider the package
uh so if you are visiting the bird park as well
you'll pay fifty-eight dollars
and that same ticket you'll visit all three attractions
normally you would have thirty days to use up the ticket
so in your two days for sure you would use it up within the thirty-day limit
yah i oh okay
so this uh this admission it's only good for just one trip and can i use all uh do i have to use the ticket within the day itself
or can i use it on separate days
no you can use it on separate days
as long as it's within thirty days of the time you buy it
oh i see
so the first visit whether it's a bird park zoo or night safari you can buy this ticket
uh except if you are buying you know bird park and night safari of course you won't be at the zoo twice
so for the three-in-one at any of these parks you buy the ticket and you make sure you keep the ticket
so they have the date on the ticket
and they will tear off which ever portion they want for your visit
okay
oh alright
okay so that's the system
yah that's the best deal
it includes taxes
uh you are not a senior citizen so you don't get the
no no i won't
so that's about sixty dollars or fifty-eight dollars for both of you
right
yes
so that would be a hundred and twenty dollars
correct
pretty cool
yah it's not bad it's not bad of a deal
so i go for that
and you've on
you've only spend three hundred dollars of your thousand dollars
wow
so i can spend the rest on food
and then uh there's also uh transportation to cover
um pu
can you show me like uh other shopping areas that are uh close
shopping areas
okay
shopping areas
yes
the best places to shop
okay just a moment
you have a lot of money
so we are sending you to the uh centre of the shopping area called orchard road
i heard about that
it's just it's like a really long street right
it's a long street but it's very walkable
because uh it's now connected by underpasses where we have shops even in the other pass
so you move from a place to place and uh where it's exposed is just a little area
so it's not very hot even if you walk
wow
it's the first time i ever heard of an underpass in singapore
that's is that like a recent
so uh no the underpasses yes it's quite recent
and uh we are trying to make it very comfortable for tourists to walk either on the road or underneath it
so that they can you know don't have to negotiate traffic light junctions
and it's a seamless travel from place to place
so here you're seeing some of the scenes
this is the little road off the main road
we have bus and eating places alfresco
behind there are also um uh restaurants in usually besides alfresco you have also um indoor dining areas
so you can shop and eat and shop and eat
uh you are looking at some of the high end brands here
uh okay
those upscale brands
well i'm not much of the upscale person
so i mean since i've a lot of money and lots of gifts to buy
uh speaking more of uh less upscale areas or shopping malls
yes
less upscale
okay
uh you are in chinatown
so i suggest you shop in chinatown for your gifts
if you have to buy lots and lots of gifts
chinatown would be the place
um hm okay
and also little india
and you can do a bit of bargaining but usually the prices are very good
just give me a moment to show you the street scene
sure
there's a lot of street side shopping in chinatown
where you can buy off the stalls uh that are in front of the shops
and you can also go into the shops to buy
they are very competitive
so prices are attractive
they would hang out signs like any three items for ten singapore dollars
or if you buy one it's two dollars
if you buy three it's five dollars
oh yah
i've heard about that
um the wholesale they called it
last time i went to bangkok
god they were telling me like if you buy at least three items in the store you get discounts
yes
uh for us it's not like this
it's not a wholesale thing
it is more uh ap an offer to attract you to buy more than one item
so you get to uh let's say a fan and uh chopsticks
it might be a mixed things or it might be just fan
so if you buy one fan for instance maybe two dollars but if they would say oh if you buy six we'll give it to you for ten dollars
so they don't consider themselves uh wholesale
it's just uh a gimmick
you know like the package for visiting the zoo the bird park and night safari to encourage you to buy more
because they know it's within the budget of tourists
yap
yah
i can see how that works and attracts people
it attracts me as well
so sometime when i travel i buy some of these things to giveaway to people
so you give one of those friends huh
uh uh yes
uh when you know it's nice to give something to people when you are away also
so here something singapore
alright
yah it's customary
like uh if you buy those little uh knick knacks
like uh little key chains
i'm not a big fan of key chains
but more of things that if people can actually use
yes
you can get uh fans
that are printed with pretty flowers
and you might want to bring one along
so that you can fan yourself as you are shopping
and you can also get chopsticks
oh what about like uh tea
like uh do does uh singapore offer like a variety of uh tea and herbs
wel yes
uh we have the chinese medicinal shops that sell chinese herbs
and they will even prescribe for you if you have a particular ailment
but let's have some of the shops first
so give me a moment
we'll try and get you pictures of some of the items in chinatown
you can see um broadly the street view
can you see that
yap
oh it's like
so this is the scene
oh so it's like they have like little stalls set up with the umbrellas and that's where they uh placed their merchandise
yes
it's at the place called sago lane
and it's right next to a big buddhist temple called buddha tooth relic temple which you can also visit if you wish
oh okay
so that's supposed to be um near the hotel
oh yes
it's within walking distance
maybe ten minutes if you walk slowly
this part of chinatown is a little bit busier and has more traffic
your side of where your hotel is it's quieter
yah okay
i like the place then. so it's
i like the place then. so it's
as yap
so that's uh that's nice because you can walk and see these things but you can go back to the quiet peaceful part of your hotel
wonderful
oh um i like to add
um because uh earlier i mentioned that uh we want to check out beaches if there are any
so uh can you recommend like uh place or if there is water park
yes beaches
i suggest you go to sentosa island
you're just interested in swimming right
well um pretty much
um yah just swimming
and oh uh also a spa
okay spas
there are in chinatown
uh you will be able to see them as you walked around
and they might have offers for you
uh generally they charge about ninety-eight dollars
but sometimes they go for sixty-eight and even less than that
uh they give you offers
so that you will sign up as a member
but uh as a tourist maybe uh no these spas here um more the upperscale ones
i think the ones in chinatown are good
you can also go again for what we called with foot reflexology
oh i like those
yes so every both days you can go
yes so every both days you can go
it's not expensive
it's about maybe it depends on the time you take it from twenty to thirty dollars according to how long
uh okay
okay let me show you beaches
oh that is sentosa island
yes
and it
uh that is huge
yes
we have uh universal studios there
uh and we'll be have museums there
two golf clubs there
but the beach you see it's nice and sandy
there are beach umbrellas
oh that is that is nice
you can also eat there
there are there's uh inexpensive like a food court where you have a variety of food
where that you can order from
how far is this from uh chinatown
and of okay
can i show you the map on the mrt on the print system
eh sure
so you have a better idea of where you are
yap
okay
uh when you come in from the airport and you at number three
and i'll come i'll talk about the train system later
yes
you follow the green line
and it's easier if you could take it all the way to outram park
and then you switch to the northeast line
okay
so it was from green at uh outram park and then the purple one to chinatown
hey that's not bad
that's right
and this stop is very near to your hotel
wow
wait uh do you know how many meters or how far and of a walking distance
uh well i count in time of minutes
maybe ten minutes or so
not bad
okay that still pretty close
very close
uh the other way if you want to go to sentosa
you take the same line
the purple line
and you go just two stops to harbourfront
and there are two ways you can go into sentosa
you can cross the road and take a light trail which is at the upper level of a big shopping centre
but it's more convenient to just take the bus shuttle in
so you walk from
so there's a bus going from harbourfront to sentosa
yes
you just have to walk a short distance when you come out of the train station
you follow the signals to say that it goes to the bus terminals
and just behind can you see behind harbourfront here on the right-hand side
it's not shown but there's a big bus terminals
and the sentosa shuttle occupies uh two bus lots
very near to the where you will be
you just wait for the bus
there will be someone there uh to guide you
and the bus will be marked sentosa
so you take it and it brings you straight in
yah
yap
oh okay
so is it the same bus uh that will take me back to harbourfront
yes on the island the same bus
yes on the island the same bus
it runs a shuttle
so what you pay is just two dollars to enter the island
and one dollar for the bus fare
okay
that's not bad
so when you come out of the island it's free of charge
in other words they collect it when you enter
and then they don't collect anymore when you come out
okay
great
i like travelling by train
i can't really take taxis or walk i mean too much or
so um when we get to sentosa island um cause the place is huge right
like where wo like how far would the bus uh stop from where you know we're supposed to go on the beach
uh hm that oh when you reached the bus train in sentosa
i think the beach is quite near or you can if the beach is not near you can just take a shuttle to near the beach
they are internal shuttles within sentosa
uh let me have a look
just hold on minute
i have uh brochure of it
okay
and sentosa island uh siloso beach
there are three beaches along sentosa
so
yah so i choose to one of them right
yes or could walk the whole distance from end to end
and have a
yah if i have a lot of time
when you reached sentosa
yes
uh you can take shuttle buses
so can you see getting there the different coloured lines
yah
blue red and green
so uh these are the buses that fly to different areas in sentosa
oh so they have their own bus in sentosa island then
so
that's right
and there also a beach tram that you can take
if you just want to have a fun ride on the beach tram you wait for it
it's very popular
okay
well um so like do these beaches have like uh theme park or water park
uh there are
like with the slides in the um like an indoor surf pool or wave
this is actually the beach
so you're on the beach
you're subject to the weather and the waves
it's very natural
it's not uh an artificial environment
okay
so they don't have that
okay
huh
if you want something exciting uh do you know how the ski on the water attached to lines
do you do things like that
yap
uh it's like wakeboarding or um water skiing
uh water skiing
it is along
yah
also that is something that's is that offered in the sentosa island as well
no not in sentosa it's on the east coast of singapore
um i forgot the name
uh it's you have to be able to swim quite well
uh because the line brings you down into the water and you are held up by the line
yah let me see if i can get it on east coast parkway
okay
uh there so much to do in the singapore
this is what oh if you want to wakeboard
yap
yah
uh we have a reservoir it is called the uh bedok
there you go wakeboarding
and this is a controlled environment
it's not the sea
it's a reservoir
oh okay so alright oh it's a safe way that way right so there aren't any sharks that come out
oh okay so alright oh it's a safe way that way right so there aren't any sharks that come out
oh okay so alright oh it's a safe way that way right so there aren't any sharks that come out
oh okay so alright oh it's a safe way that way right so there aren't any sharks that come out
uh we don't have sharks in singapore
oh that's a relief
uh don't mind actually it will be fun
we don't see some we see dolphins occasionally
but uh yah it's a little bit rare
if you are on a boat ride out
then you get to see uh the dolphins
oh really
have you ever seen one
uh yes i have uh of near to changi actually
just for a second
and it was a tourist who said to me did you see the dolphin
i said i thought i saw a little bit but i thought it was screaming.
but he saw it
so it must have been real
oh it's oh so if you blink too fast you will miss it
that's right
uh we get turtles landing on our beach occasionally
oh i love to see that
i've never seen turtles
um you can't really see it because we find them accidentally
and then what happens is the public will inform underwater world which is on sentosa
it's a lovely aquarium
and
oh we have an aquarium
oh can you show that to me
i didn't know there was an aquarium in sentosa
you want to see the aquarium
yes please
uh underwater world sentosa okay
so is that separate from the uh the singapore zoo that we saw earlier
the reserves
yes that is separate
that would be on this island called sentosa where you go to the beach
so you would cover this on the same day you go the beach
oh wow
okay
so i can see where the beach is um from that map
and then
okay
can you see this
here instead of diving
or scuba diving
eh what happened to the picture
yah uh i'm trying to
just give us a moment
okay
so what happened is let me described it to you
you see uh marine fishes which are very colorful
the ones in the tropics
yap
yes
and you'll see them in displayed in uh like an aquarium environment
but you also get underground where there is a whole aquarium around you
and it's like you are on display to the fishes
like so instead of like me being the uh one watching the animals they're watching us
yes that's right
so uh th
that's a good way to put it
you will stand on the travelator
and there are signboards at the side to show you
you know usually what's animal uh what species is there they will display it
and there's also attached to this aquarium uh dolphin show
so we have sharks
you can even see baby sharks that are in the process of being uh hatched you know from the eggs
wow
in the show you are seeing here there's a dolphin interacting
yah
uh you will just pay a little fee and it will get a little bit wet
you don't have to go all the way in
but you can go down shake hands with the no not suppose
oh that is cool
i wanna try that
you have to show me the prices or rates for those
okay uh underwater world
uh this is if you dive
okay a hundred and twenty dollars if you actually bring your diving suit and dive
and if you swim a hundred and seventy
oh i would like the one with the uh in the dolphin swimming with the dolphins
i don't think i want to go near the sharks
yes
uh no the sharks you don't get to swim to do anything with them
except see them behind glass
uh okay
uh so that's that no it's a very safe environment here in the singapore
we don't expose tourists to any risk
and we think dolphins are pretty friendly
uh so if you are prepared then you need to bring your swimming costume
okay
yah
that's definitely i must
yah and the and the package includes a t-shirt souvenir and your boyfriend can take your photograph for you
so that's good right
yah
you have money left over
if you are generous and you want the fish to uh have a nibble at your feet
can you see fish reflexology
yap
you put your fish uh put your feet
sorry into uh a very shallow uh something like a pool where they have tiny little fishes that nibble away at you the dead skin of your soles of your feet and all that
oh it's like the fish spa
the um i think i've seen that on tv somewhere
have you tried it
yes it's uh i tried it
it's a little bit ticklish
so some people enjoy it
some people find it a little bit too ticklish
um but it's fun
okay
so at least i know it's not painful then
pardon
at least i know it's not painful
oh no it's not painful at all
and it's uh quite popular
so you sit around and you can all laughter at each other
uh because some fish will maybe prefer a certain foot more than the other's
so that would say a lot about that person's feet
yes uh so uh we don't have much time
um do you have anything else you would like to ask
no i i've pretty much seen everything i wanted to see
so yah i'm then set on you know going to singapore
uh hm that's very good
so you can um have shopping money and you can apportion some of it to uh maybe a treat for yourself
and then the rest to uh souvenirs that you want to buy for friends to bring back
yes definitely
okay
so you're comfortable taking the trains you take the ez-link ticket from the basement of the airport
you pay and deposit for the price you gonna spend
and then you can get your refund before you leave singapore
yap
okay
