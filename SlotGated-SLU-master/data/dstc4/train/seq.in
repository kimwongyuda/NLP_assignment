so i'll just call you edrelin
yes please
okay
yes
and you were saying that you wanted to come to singapore
uh maybe can i have a little bit more details like uh when will you be coming
and like who will you be coming with
uh yes
um i'm actually planning to visit uh on august
alright
uh and i'm planning to take with me my husband and my son
alright
and how old is your son
uh my son is actually turning ten
uh i'm uh we're planning to go to singapore on his birthday
that's actually his birthday august twenty sixth
okay
so um yah so i'm planning to take him there
a sort of like a birthday gift
okay that's good
that's a very nice birthday gift
yes
okay
and how many days will you be uh spending in singapore
uh actually it would be just for a one day stopover
okay
so um i'm what i want is to uh seek advice from you like how we can um actually maximise that
uh huh
and is this your first time to singapore
uh yes it is
okay
alright
and has any of your friends or relatives came to singapore before
uh yes i've had a couple of uh friends or officemates who actually you know who've been to singapore before
but i haven't gotten really much um information from them
okay you will be arriving at singapore on the twenty fifth i guess
so that you can spend twenty sixth of august here
yah
oh yah that would be great
alright
and um you will be taking a flight in uh do you also need me to like advise you how do you get from the airport
and i presume you'll be staying in a hotel as well
uh yes please
that will be great since it's my first time so you know i need directions
okay and you will probably leave singapore on the twenty seventh
right
correct
okay
alright
okay so uh what are your son like any theme park or what is he like
what does he prefer
yah
what i'm planning to do is actually to take him to um
uh universal studios
yes
um that's uh
that would be my sort of um gift to him
uh okay
and your husband does he like uh
what kind of food does he like then
um me and my husband actually that's really our main uh goal why we want to go to singapore is really um to really try out the food
um i think any uh we really want to try out like maybe the signature um dishes in singapore
like you know it's like if you've been to singapore you have to really taste this or eat this
alright
okay
like like chili crabs
yes
if is that the signature dish of singapore
okay
uh yes
because uh a lot of people likes to eat this food including the local people as well
okay
okay
um and of course uh pepper crabs as well
okay
uh so i think we the locals here generally if we have friends coming over we like to introduce them to these uh dishes
okay
um i actually want to try out because uh i've watched in the television like asian food network over here that there are a lot of um i think they call it the hawker um
yes
it's yah
i will
the hawker food
yes
okay
yah maybe you could also you know give us an idea on you know where we should go to you know have a try on that place
right
okay
and alright maybe i can do a recommendation now
okay
um okay if like if you arrived in the airport we have three terminals at the moment
um so you probably arrive let's say terminal one changi airport
okay
that's located on the eastern part of singapore
and you will be checking in to the hotel
let's say if you are putting up in the orchard road hotel
uh that is like about thirty minutes drive by taxi to the orchard road hotels
okay
so there are quite a number of hotels there
so again it depends on your budget
it's like one straight road
okay
and that's very convenient because we have the subway train station out there
as well as the uh buses and it is also the main shopping belt
okay
okay
can i
all items
yes
um i'm sorry
go ahead
uh i was
okay
uh so i was thinking also maybe uh since you have only one day in singapore
you could also try taking the subway uh to your hotel which we call it the mrt
oh yah i've heard about that
and uh mrt
okay
correct
so what you can do is once you arrived in the airport you can go to the subway train station
you just look for direction
it's pretty clear
uh you look for the direction that says uh city train
and you go down uh to the train station and you can buy uh a tourist card
or okay since it's only one day i think what you can do is you just buy a standard card
uh on this train it's actually uh east-west line
okay
okay
so this is um from the east you'll be travelling down to city hall mrt train station
okay
so i think maybe the easiest since you only have one day
i would recommend that you stay in the uh city hall
there are two hotels there for you to choose
okay
um may i have a do you have an idea lynnette like how much does it cost in that hotel
okay
uh it's about in the region of singapore dollars
uh three hundred dollars per room
oh okay
um because here's the thing
um i only actually have one thousand
alright
um singaporean dollar
so um let's say that um given my budget so maybe i have to um have more money for but if it would be me my husband and my son that would be considered as a package tour right
uh not necessary
okay
you can actually just come in take the subway to the hotel
and uh you can do a one way tour and i will do a few recommendation for you uh so you don't have to spend that much money
okay
okay
so let's say it's uh the three of us and then i only have one thousand dollars
so let's um so if we do with the hotel which cost you said three hundred dollars right
yes
right
okay
so the three hundred dollars is already good for the three of us if like we stay in one room
yes
okay
and then we'll uh i think we'll just go ahead and take the subway then because i think that's much cheaper if uh compared to riding a taxi correct
yes
because the taxi ride from the airport to the orchard road will probably cost you about again depending on the timing that you have arrive uh in the region of let's say forty dollars singapore dollars
so all the prices i'm quoting you will be in singapore dollars
okay
so mrt you mentioned that i just have to buy a standard card
yes
okay and how much does the standard card um cost
okay and how much does the standard card um cost
okay
it depends on which uh particular location that you are going to
okay
uh so let's say we will have to choose
let's say now maybe i'll just talk to you first before i show you the map the city map
uh and also some hotels
okay sure
alright
so it all depends alright
the mrt ride ranges from about two dollars uh to let's say three dollars
but because if you are buying a standard card there is actually a dollar deposit
okay
so let's say if the taxi the mrt cost one dollar for example then you will have to put two dollars into the machine
okay
yah
so i will suggest that when you are let's say your husband is trying to get uh retrieve the bags uh at the conveyor belt
at the belts
uh there are also money changer inside uh the airport area
okay
so maybe one can take care of the bags
uh the other person will go and change some money first
some singapore money
okay
just uh change a little bit of money just for your meals in the hotel uh in the hawker centres
alright
as well as for the ride to the hotel
okay
alright
so i estimated
maybe you can change about singapore dollars two hundred dollars first
alright
two hundred dollars first
yah
uh or anything more but i think this is just for my recommendation
just some money to get by for the short while
you can always change money in the hotel with the hotel cashier
okay
or if you're going to stay in near any of the shopping centres uh there's always a money changer in the shopping centre
so you can always change your money there
okay
got it
thank you
yah
and if you are spending let's say money in the uh shopping centre uh or buying tickets to universal studio you can always pay them with credit cards
okay
yah
so i think the most uh advisable time for us to arrive is really in the morning right
so that we could have all afternoon and stay there up until um the night
is that a good time
yes
right
so i mean if you are going to because it's a short flight from philippines so you can arrive in the morning on saturday uh on the twenty sixth uh and then you stay overnight the next day
oh
okay
yah
or of course if you can have a bit more time you can arrive prior to twenty sixth twenty fifth
and then you leave on the twenty seventh
uh hm yah i think i'll go with the twenty fifth and then will have you know um twenty sixth
yes
and then yah leave on the twenty seventh
i think that's much better
yah
okay
so you will have like a two night stay in singapore
uh hm right
okay
uh so from the hotel okay so um you mentioned that it's only thirty minutes uh from the hotel to get to i mean from the airport to get to the hotel is that correct
okay from if you're taking the subway
uh because this is a east-west line um you will have to change uh the line in city hall
uh so i think better that you reserve forty five minutes
oh
okay
forty five minutes that's fine
yah
alright
it's pretty frequent
uh so of course to be very detailed
uh always check with the information counter at the mrt train station
we call our subway the mrt
yah
okay
so there are like certain hotels you can stay
uh maybe the landmark hotel over at the near to the bugis area
okay
landmark hotel
yah
and um this is do we do you would you consider this uh as more of a like a child friendly or a family uh friendly type of a hotel
you know given that i have a kid with me
um okay
this is just a normal kind of a hotel
okay
uh so they do have uh quite a lot of family staying in this hotel as well
okay good
uh yah
so i don't think you will require like any special uh items for the for your child right
because the whole day you'll be out
uh yah
correct yah
yah
okay
so um let's say uh if we arrived already at the hotel
yes
so um from there we can already like maybe go to universal studios
is that near this hotel
uh yah it's pretty convenient
because again you can take the subway
so what you do is okay let's say we skip the arrival part right
i mean that's done right
you are quite uh you know what's going on from your airport you take the subway
alright
to the hotel
alright
and uh so let's say we start on the twenty sixth
okay
twenty sixth
i'll begin first for breakfast
try some local food
yes on the twenty sixth itself
uh of course if you want to have the hotel breakfast you can always because most of the time breakfast will be included in your hotel package
yes
alright
okay
if you decide not to do it not to take the hotel breakfast
i would suggest that you come out from the hotel
just go across the road
there is a little uh coffee shop
do you take spicy food
i actually love spicy food
oh that's great
uh yah
i've been to india before so um yah i actually i like it
okay
so what you can do is you just go across the road
there are small cafes just across your road the road
and uh there is quite a famous i would say uh roti prata store
it's uh what they serve is like pancake
okay
but it's an indian pancake
oh cool
yah
and uh
i'd like to try that
yah
so you can try that
and they have another dish called murtabak
it has all kind of fillings in there chicken
uh beef uh even sardine
alright
and they pan fry it
it's a dough they pan fry it
and you can eat it with your hands just like the locals
okay
right
it's a piece of pancake
you tear out into small pieces and you dip them in curry
oh cool
but of course if you don't want you can always use the spo and oh fork and spoon
okay
alright
so you can have that for breakfast it's quite a filling dish
so maybe i'll suggest that uh a one piece it depends on what kind of meat you order
it ranges from five dollars singapore dollars onwards
okay
so you can order just two pieces to try or maybe you can try that
and you can also uh do a bee hoon goreng
it's like fried uh noodles
okay
but it's malay style
alright
alright
okay
so you just order a small uh two dish is fine for 3 person
oh alright
so the serving is actually um quite big
alright
quite big
yes it's quite big
and you can also have uh one of our tea
like a teh tarik kind of a tea
um it's like a pull tea
okay
alright
okay
tea with milk and they pull the tea
so you have a lot of foam on your tea
so that is this is something very local as well
alright
yes so you can have that
and then you just walk towards the subway uh which will be the bugis mrt
okay
it's about seven minutes walk
and you take the subway uh to the harbourfront
alright
um i'm just concerned
um well singapore i think majority uh of the people there uh are already english um speakers right
so if we ask for direction um or or you know instructions or something like that
so we would be able to uh communicate with them okay
okay
yes no problem
uh majority of us here speaks english uh because english is our first language and all our sign are all in english
okay good
yes
so if there's any uh problem you need directions please feel free to approach anybody that looks like a local
alright
okay
i think there's some yah
cause i don't you know i'm we might have a difficult time right
um communicating
so that's good that uh we will be able the majority of the people uh can speak english so alright
great
yah so it's not a real issue
uh okay the mrt again uh i would suggest that uh you take a map of the mrt so that you have a better idea how to travel
okay
because again uh from your hotel to the uh to harbourfront where you're going to i would say that i think you'll just do universal studio on sentosa on the twenty sixth
so you will have to change your mrt ride over at dhoby ghaut because that will be the uh north east line
north east
okay
yah
so i think the detailed part i think we should you should be able to work it out right
um yah
so if i go to the mrt and then i just have to tell uh i just would have to identify on which uh station is that what you call it
on which station i we should be um going
yah
yes
and then
uh okay no all our mrt we have this map out there
we have a map
oh
alright
okay
let me try and get you the uh mrt map
so there are a few lines okay from the airport is the east to the west line in jurong
then we have the north to the south line
and we have another line the north east line
uh and a circle line
right now these are uh the lines that's available
okay
so once you get down to the mrt uh you will be able to see uh the map
okay i have opened up the uh mrt lines for you to see
would you be able do you were you are you able to copy that
um uh i'm not able to see it on my um screen yet
okay
um i think uh you have to share that with me for me to able to see it on my screen over here
alright
uh okay
can you see the east side
the green colour line
hm no i'm not seeing anything yet on my screen over here
you're not seeing anything
uh would you be able nothing at all
yah
yah nothing
okay
the alright okay
the changi side is on the east
it's on the green line
okay
okay can you see now
uh okay
it's starting to download
uh alright
yes i can see it now
alright
okay
can you see the green line
okay
uh yes
okay
can you see on the right-hand side
it says number three changi airport
yes
alright
so that is actually the east west line
so can you follow towards your left-hand side
okay
my left hand
uh to the left
and then you yah the green line go to the left
to the left
alright
okay
and then you will see city hall
city hall let me check that
where is that
just go to the left
so from changi
okay
changi you will see expo
expo right
yes
and then you will see bedok kembangan all the rest
just follow the green line
alright
okay
okay
uh and you will come to bugis
oh there i see it now
i see city hall
yes
yah
okay
alright
okay
so you can stay in this hotel called landmark
okay
or alternatively there is another hotel which is very convenient just lavender
lavender
yes just before bugis
okay
yah there's another hotel there
it's called v hotel
it's called a new v uh victory
v
v alright v hotel
yeah
yah
so you can stay there as well
it's i think these two locations are pretty convenient
at least you know you don't have to change lines
oh
right i agree
well from the airport yes all the way and v hotel is just directly next to the lavender hotel uh mrt
right yah
i think that's
so once you come out yah once you come out the hotel it's there
yah i think that's much a much better option
okay
for convenience
yah
and like i said
again breakfast time no issue
uh just outside your hotel there are lots of eating places
and you can get a breakfast for uh there's a food court
a food court is an air-conditioned uh it's a modern version of the non air-conditioned hawker centres
ok oh okay
yah
so you can choose like if you want uh just drinks you want chinese food you want fried noodles
so you can do that for your breakfast and then you carry on your tour to sentosa
but right
yah alright
so sentosa uh alright
so let's say we're done with breakfast
so we're going
where is universal studios here
alright
is it also along with the green lines
okay then so okay you will have to change your train at uh city hall
okay
okay and after that you will have to change to the red line
hm alright
okay can you see city hall
and then you go up
up alright
yah
and then you see dhoby ghaut
uh let me
just one station
dhoby there yes i saw it
yes
okay and from there you change to the purple line
purple line
is that also in the red one or the oh the purple line
yah
okay
purple line
so you go downwards
alright
downwards
oh
downwards here
you'll see clarke quay chinatown and
correct
and uh harbour yah harbourfront
harbourfront
yah
so you will alight at harbourfront
okay
okay
so i think i will not confuse you with telling you all the cost of the mrt ride
what you do is when you get down at the mrt you just you know there will be machine
it's very easy to operate
you just press like which direction which station you are going to
press harbourfront
okay
and the machine will tell you how much to pay
alright
so when you are taking the subway please remember to take a small singapore money with you
okay
alright
like a five dollars kind of and a two dollars and some coins
okay
alright
there is change given but they accept the smaller notes
yup
okay
yah
so you alight at harbourfront
okay
and from harbourfront uh you can take the cable car
okay
inside sentosa
inside sentosa
yah
um do we have to pay for that as well
yes
the cable car ride uh i will suggest that you take like uh one way
uh it's about twelve dollars
okay
per person
and then once you're in sentosa
and also please remember to pack a change of clothes and also like maybe swimming gear as well
okay
okay
why
oh okay
because if you have time you can go swimming in our beautiful lagoon on sentosa
oh cool
nice
alright
yah and in case you know your son play some of the games he may get wet
so i think yah please bring a change of clothes
alright
thank you
okay huh
so what you do is like if you are going early in the morning i suggest you go to a short while to the beach
yah
and on sen
yah i would like that
yah
on sentosa itself you can go on the uh okay i'll close this uh mrt uh map
alright sure
and then i will show you the sentosa map
okay
you can get by using the buses on sentosa
uh and the buses that operates on sentosa were uh they are free
alright they are already included in your fare
oh
alright
that's nice
so sentosa is actually um because i'm seeing your screen right now
so it's actually an island
yes it's an island just about one kilometre away from the mainland
uh it's on the southern part of singapore
so i think now you can see the map the whole map now
uh yes
okay
can you see something blinking in the top left corner
uh blinking top left corner
yes
okay and you see uh tall tower and then there's something down that has a little bit of u
right
okay can you see my arrow
yes i can
this arrow
okay so you can take the cable car alright across
okay that is optional
so let's see how you we you know oh after you
i think yah that's a nice ride here
okay and on sentosa you see all these roads
okay
uh you can travel on the buses sentosa buses
okay
okay and they are colour coded as well
but uh again you just look at where you are going to
alright
so i would suggest that you go to the lagoon
okay can you see siloso beach
can you see my arrow
yes i can
okay
so you can do the beach out here for early morning swim
that's nice
yes spend about uh one hour
alright
and then you can go to universal studio
alright
so universal studios is actually within sentosa
yes it's on sentosa itself
can you see resort world
oh
yes
yah
so it's actually over this side
nice alright
okay and of course it's like a theme park
so you can see uh you know you can basically spend like three quarter of a day or almost a day
uh in the park and uh you can do a lot of attractions there
alright
um so the ticket we have to buy it on the place itself
uh you can also buy uh online before you arrive
okay
so we can buy it online as well
yes
and do you have an idea how much would the ticket cost
okay
uh a day pass for the adult will cost singapore dollars sixty six dollars
uh and a child will be forty eight dollars
okay
sixty six
yah
and forty eight
but um
okay
but just to check again let me see
the date twenty sixth august is that a weekday or weekend
okay
so there's a yah there's a difference in the price when if it's a weekday or a weekend
yes correct
so like at weekend it will be at seventy two dollars for the adult and a child will be fifty two dollars
okay
so let's
okay
let me just check
twenty sixth august
it's a sunday
sure
that's nice
yes
but that's but it's much but the price is uh a bit higher
but that's fine
yah it's fine
it's just a few dollars difference
yah it's a few dollars
and it's a birthday gift
it's a birthday treat
right
yah
correct
okay
okay
so you can do uh uh there are quite a few shows there as well
there are few shows that you can do
uh there's a madagascar there is this uh the ride in the movie transformer
i think your son will like that
the ride transformer
definitely
my son and my husband are actually fans of transformers
so i'm sure they will like that
uh okay
yes
so that is a nice uh ride to do
uh and of course there are other shows and i think i will suggest that lunch you just have a meal in universal studio itself
okay
because you know it takes time to come out and then go in again
so i'll just i will suggest that lunch you have it in universal studio
so they have like fast food available
uh to local food as well
uh so maybe just a quick lunch like a sandwich or something
okay
and then carry on
depending on how much uh your son would like to stay in there
okay
how much time he wants to spend there right
yes
okay
so because the uh universal studio opening hours it's from ten a.m. to seven p.m
okay
alright
yah
so maybe you know we could stay there for like um i'm not sure
maybe five to you know six hours
something like that
yah
that's right
so you could spend like let's say from ten o'clock you know if you go early in the morning for your swim
or even if you don't want to swim just take a walk in the bea uh in around the beach area
and then you just take a sentosa bus to the universal studio or you can also take the uh what do you call that
the train on sentosa itself
okay
alright
uh those are all included so you don't have to pay extra money
uh then you go to universal studio spend let's say from ten or ten thirty onwards right up to about five thirty
yah
or even six
and then you go for your dinner with the chili crabs
yah great
alright
so from there you again you can take the subway to the clarke quay
from harbourfront to clarke quay
i think oh
okay there are quite a few restaurants there
uh and you can have your chili crabs out there
okay great
um what about for uh you know shopping
uh because i think one um singapore is also um popular with when it comes to because you know we're about to go home already right
because we're done with dinner and we have before we leave so we have to shop
so um i know that singapore is very popular when it comes to gadgets
right
yes
right
um because i've heard from my friends that you can actually buy like gadgets in singapore uh for a much cheaper price
and also the quality is really good
so um do you know for a place wherein you know my husband because he's a techy person
right
my husband can go and maybe you know check for cell phones laptop or ipad something like that
alright you can go to this place
uh again if you're going to stay in the lavender mrt area
uh it's just like two station away from where you are
um you go to funan centre
okay
yah
uh they have all the gadgets out there
so maybe if you before you come you know you can always check on the prices first
okay
and uh because there are so many shops out there that sells similar items so they are pretty uh i would say very attractive prices
okay
so it's like a one uh stop shop for like different gadgets
okay
yah
yah
so there's also competition going on between um the sellers there
yes so what you maybe they may not be able to give you like a lot of discount
uh but they can always give you freebies because they know that if you go into the shop and you walked out you'll probably end up buying from someone else
alright
okay
so it's quite reputable the shops there
so i will recommend like this location so you can do your shopping out there
and let's say your you can leave your husband there for yourself oh yourself or i'm sorry your husband and your son if your son is interested in a technical product
then what you do is you walk over to city hall mrt
yes
correct
and you do your shopping out there
our shops are open until nine thirty
okay
so you
because you're just ten minutes away from one another
oh that's nice
so we can actually separate from each other and i can do my own shopping
yah
yah
so um here you have like clothes uh you know shoes bags all those stuff
yes
so you have uh in the raffles place uh sorry raffles city because it's just above the city hall mrt
uh they have from the branded alright like the gucci and everything else
right up to the midrange products
right
so it's uh about three three levels of shopping
and also we have an underground shopping area uh called citylink
okay citylink
alright
so they have all yes they have all your shoes your clothes
the ladies the gents
toiletries cosmetics everything is in there
okay
alright
and how's the price
um is it like um somewhat similar to um hong kong or you could say that it's actually much cheaper
it's different because the quality here uh is better i would say
it's not like the street kind of uh shopping
they are shops
so the quality is good i would say
so it all depends
let's say if you are buying the branded product i think here in singapore we are still relatively affordable
okay
okay
uh and uh if you are buying the midrange products uh they are in uh i would say a good condition
okay
great
alright
and on top of that you can always claim back the gst the goods and services tax
hm alright
which is like uh seven per cent
and it's so easy you know
you once you arrived back in the airport when you are leaving singapore you just produce the receipt that has been stamped uh sorry
uh that is given by the retailer
and let's say if you are putting your purchases in your luggage so you have that checked by uh officials before you check in your bags
okay
hm okay
alright
so if you are buying smaller items like uh jewellery watches then you can have your uh gst refund um just before you board the plane
once you cleared the immigration you look out for this sign that says gst and you can claim back your money immediately if you like
in whatever currency you like
or you can even charge that back to your card and they will mail back the uh refund to you when you're back in the philippines
wow that's actually nice
alright
yah
yah so it's very convenient
yah i like that
yes so i think for one day you may not have that much time uh to do your shopping but uh so i suggest like let's say you come out from sentosa about five thirty
you can have your dinner
okay
alright
or you can even uh let's say to save time you can even spe have your dinner in vivocity
okay
alright
because when you're at universal studio you take the sentosa train out you're already at vivocity
vivo
vivo v i v o
okay vivocity
yah
so let's see
okay
that's also within sentosa right
uh it's just out of uh sentosa
okay
so what you do is when you're finished with sentosa let's say i suggest about five thirty right
uh you just take the sentosa train
and you will be out in this big shopping centre
there are lots of restaurants out there and you can
okay
okay
okay
so this is like a mall
okay
yes it's a shopping mall
uh again
it's a shopping mall
yes
so if you don't want to get out of this place you can also do your shopping out here
okay
uh and uh but since your husband wants to do the tech product so i think i would suggest that you have your dinner there
and then proceed to uh funan centre
okay
yah to get his products
okay
or alternatively you can do this in the morning uh before you go on to sentosa island
alright
okay
so yah because the shops will open like uh ten thirty in the morning
so you can for funan uh about ten thirty eleven
so you can go from uh funan
funan
do a bit yes
so allocate let's say about one hour
okay
shopping time for him
and then you go on to sentosa let's say at about uh in the afternoon
one o'clock twelve o'clock
you'll be in sentosa
okay you can do your lunch again if you are doing funan you can go down to the hawker centre in the basement area
have your food
and then go to sentosa
yah
okay
so that's thank you for giving me a lot of uh options
but then yah
okay i hope you have an idea now how to plan
yah
um lynnette just uh one more question
because i saw a while ago uh while we were in that sentosa park um that there was also something mentioned there about like spas
okay
um so uh like within sentosa there are also places where i can like maybe get a massage or you know something like that
yes
there is a spa there as well
uh so while your kids are enjoying and your husband enjoying their time in universal you can go for your spa
okay
alright
so that's also is that outside universal or within universal
it's outside universal
oh okay
yah
alright
okay
or alternatively if your husband is doing his shopping down in funan you can always get your spa done uh at the uh nearby uh hotel area
there are some spas there as well
okay
yah
and um the price range
sorry cause i'm you know i'm um budget conscious
and the price range uh could you give me an idea on that
yah alright
yes
uh i
you know if i
just the full body or just uh the legs
the feet
yah maybe like a full body massage
like you know from like thirty minutes to an hour of that
how much would that cost
okay approximately about a hundred dollars
okay
yah
hundred dollars
yes
alright
okay
so um okay i think tentatively that's what i can suggest since it's like a one day programme
uh so i hope you got an idea now
um yes i did
actually it's very um informative
so thank you for giving me a lot of options
um so again just another question
yes
what about in terms of giving like tips
uh oh yah
so um how what's your um suggestion on that
okay uh in singapore we don't really practice uh giving of tips but of course if you're very happy with the service uh you're welcome to do so
but otherwise we uh don't have a compulsory tipping but if you're in the uh if you're having your meals in the restaurants they do have a service charge there already
oh
okay
so it's not really um a requirement to give you know tips and all that
yah it's not compulsory
okay
got it
yah
okay
alright
alright
so thank you
yah
yah
that's basically it
thank you so much lynnette
um this is very helpful
alright
welcome
alright
thank you
okay
bye
okay
bye
hi good morning
hello good morning
this is participant two
hi this is uh tour guide uh one my name is lynnette and can i get your name
uh hello my name is marissa
and i'm planning um a tour in singapore for maybe um a day or two but probably um it's maybe a couple of days
okay
so can i say about three days
yes
hm i think um yah maybe maximum of three days
okay
and melissa uh when would you be uh which period of time are you coming in
yah
um i think that would be on um first week of april
first week of april that's pretty soon uh
yah because uh that would be um a holiday here in our country so it would give me time to you know relax also from work
okay
alright
so melissa um in order for me to help you to plan your stay in singapore uh would you be able to give me some details like how many uh like who will you be coming with and you know is there any special thing that you'd like to do here
well i think i'll be bringing um a couple of my friends
i think my two best friends are also interested to come in with me
um we like to you know we are very um we three are um we like to eat so we would like to explore the cuisine singaporean cuisine and also um see um beautiful spots there and also where we could um shop and also relax
so do you think um three days would suffice for us to do all that
also one of my friend um she likes to do you know um something extreme like uh she likes wall climbing and do para um zip lining
parasailing
uh yah
did you have that also
okay
alright
so the well of course if you can spare five times that would be great but uh
yah it's no issue
i mean three days i could we could still do everything that uh you would like to do and uh i guess your friends the age one would be about twenty to thirty
yes
uh hm okay
and uh your budget will be in a range of a thousand dollars
um i think uh we would add would that be in singaporean or in peso in us dollars
i'm not really very um particular with the exchange rate yet uh but i um individually i think our price range budget would be from thirty five to forty five thousand each
pesos so i think that would be
uh singa
the
so okay everything that i quoted here will be in the region of a thousand dollars so that means three person will be three thousand singapore dollars
a thousand uh oh three thousand okay
alright yah
is that correct
yes
it's correct yah
yah
okay alright
so uh because right now okay we'll first of all we will be doing all the things the local people do because you are still young right
so you can take the subway to from the airport to your hotel
uh so what i will suggest is the subway is located on the eastern part of singapore in the area called changi and you can take the east-west line
uh hm that will be great
yes
uh huh east-west line
yah
so um from the airport to uh if we take the subway we can see the um city the scenery of singapore already right
yes
and the
just hold on uh
okay
okay because i'm opening up uh the subway map for you
okay
okay can you see the map now
the mrt map
um i think um it's too small
too small
yah
i
yah it's okay now
i can see it
it's okay now
yes
okay
alright can you see the number three
number three yes
on your right hand side
yes i can see it
okay
that's where changi airport is
changi uh hm
hm that's on the east
east oh this is the eastern part of singapore okay
east oh this is the eastern part of singapore okay
yes so you'll see a few colours right
so the green line will be the east-west line
so can you see number two on your left hand side
yah
yes
oh it's far
it's from the it's it's in the other part
so that is west
yah
so i'm just giving you the green line that is from the east to the west
okay and the red line will be the north
north
the red one so that's the north
yah
okay
yah can you see like uh woodlands that's in the north okay
come again
woodlands
okay can you see the top
woodlands yes
i can see the woodlands
uh okay
and then down will be number ten can you see number ten
number ten no
right down
right down
southwest uh south towards the south number ten
number ten
um can you bring it down a little more
yah a little bit more
uh yah
that's the maximum number ten
yes i can see number ten already
okay
that
that's marina bay
okay that's the north yes
uh north
that's the north-south line
uh huh north
and then we have the purple line
yah purple line
east-west line uh sorry north-east line
east north-east
yah
and then the yellow line
that's the circle line
that's the
circle
circle
circle yeah
uh okay
and uh this is our latest line
alright
so this is the map of our subway
so it's fairly easy to get around uh our uh sub by using the subway and you will save like quite a lot of money instead of taking the taxis
and of course you can always do some sight-seeing while you're taking the subway right because uh away from the centre part of the of singapore the trains will be running above ground
yes
yes
yah
so you actually get to view uh you know the some parts uh of the island uh and you know if you feel like stopping you can always stop
oh okay
oh so um this um coloured square these are um substation right that we can always stop if we wanted to
that's where you ha yes correct
um great
alright
okay so i will close this map so you have an idea right how the subway trains run
okay
yah so what i will suggest is uh when you arrive singapore you can get a map of the subway trains and it's just like any other country in the world
uh let's say you are from changi and you want to go to paya lebar
can you see the junction of the yellow and green line
yes
okay so let say you're going there
so what you do is you go to the train station and you will press paya lebar and the machine will tell you how much is the cost
alright so you just put in the singapore money accordingly
so again i'll suggest that you change some uh singapore money at the airport
there's a money changer inside before you come out before you collect your bags there's a money changer there
paya lebar
uh okay
okay
okay
and when you just come out from uh the transit area from the airport uh there are also money changer just immediately outside the uh uh the airport area
alright
uh hm okay
yes
so you change some money first in order for you to take the subway to get to your hotel alright
so try to get some smaller notes like two dollars and five dollars
okay
so if from changi airport uh until paya lebar
lebar
yah uh how much would it cost in the subway train
okay if you are taking the um uh if you are using because you i think you will be spending a few days so what you can do is you can a buy a uh you can buy this uh a tourist card
oh a tourist card yah
that's the one you're gonna use um that card you will be using when you're going to ride in the lrt right so that uh you won't be buying um purchasing tickets when going in and out of the train
yah
yes
correct
because uh our standard card let's say if the price is a dollar you have to put in two dollars because there is a one dollar deposit and when you leave the station you have to get back your deposit
okay
oh i see
so there's a deposit when you ride the train okay
yah because of uh the cards
so you must remember to get back your deposit after you exit from the uh the barrier alright
so like i said since you're spending a few days you can buy the uh the tourist card or you can buy this stored value card as well
okay yes
hm okay
yah
yah
so of course there is also uh uh a deposit that's uh given to the stored value card
alright
okay
okay
yah so because we also have like uh different timing let's say uh morning off-peak hours there are certain and it's slightly cheaper
so i think
yah
so only way to save to you save quite a lot travelling on the mrt
so we call our subway the mrt
okay mrt
just like here we call it also mrt
oh okay
yah so no issue uh so every all the information are given in english uh so it's no problem for you if you're coming from philippines
yah
yes
yes
yes
yah
so and if you need any help just feel free to approach our station uh our customer service is open
you know the mrt uh train station there's always uh office you know you can approach them for help
yes
okay that's great
yah that's great
so we have to buy these cards in mrt in the morning so that they're much cheaper
so um these cards they have different prices within the day
uh no we just have the morning uh off-peak hours but the rest of the day is the same price
yah
ah okay
yah
okay so now once you let say from the hotel uh do you have any hotel in mind that you want to stay
um actually not yet
so do you think you can suggest some where we could stay
hm alright
there are quite a number of uh hotels that you can stay uh the i guess you don't really mind like uh budget hotels
yah no of course not
yah
okay we have uh in bencoolen
okay it
bencoolen
bencoolen it's near to city hall
and since it's near in the city hall so that i
do you have also um like uh museums there near
yes we do have
uh yah
yah
s
yah
so that is like uh bencoolen hotel bayview hotel it's just in city hall so it's fairly convenient for you
so what you do is you take the train uh of course you have to get off at expo uh tanah merah and then you change to the next train to get down to the uh you use back the green line the east-west line you alight at city hall
uh o yes
yes
and from there it's just about seven to ten minutes walk to the hotel
oh okay
that's great
so and
okay so around your hotel there are lot of things to do
okay you can try some uh local food there as well
yah we would like to do that
yah
uh okay i'm just opening up the bayview hotel
alright
it's just uh five minutes i would say bras basah to dhoby ghaut station
okay so you just even if you don't want to change station you can actually do a short walk from the city
short walk uh okay
yah
i think walking would be much better because you know while walking we can look around to see the
right
uh yah
yah
so uh from the city hall it's just about ten minutes i would say to the hotel
um of course these are like i would say city hotel so the rooms are not that big
yah
but i guess you'll be out of the whole day right
yes definitely
yah
so just go back and sleep yah
so okay and out there we have very nice uh uh museum
we have the uh national museum
so
okay
again it's just walk alright
just across from your hotel you can spend easily you know two hours i would say minimum one hour in the museum
one hour in the museum
so um what can we expect to see in the museum
yeah
alright we have a gallery uh the history of singapore
uh it's at the back part which is also the newest part of the museum
uh you can do you get a good overview of singapore history from the early uh uh before raffles time right through uh modern singapore
so just to do that gallery you need minimum forty five minutes
yes
yes that's good
yes
so that's forty five minutes for that single gallery alone
yah
yah because it's quite a big gallery and it's very uh i would say it's very well planned so you will get a very good overview of singapore history
that's good that's very interesting
yah if you yah and if you have time you can do we have living galleries uh on the second level
uh we have like fashion food
yah so yah uh i would say then you go to if you have time alright our food gallery
uh well that will give you an introduction to some of our local food
yah
alright so you can do that
and if your other friends or yourself would like to do some art uh pieces we have a very good museum just across from the national museum it's called sam s a m
yes
yes that's good
s a sam museum
yes sam
yah it's we don't call it sa uh yah you can call it sam
uh it's actually in full it stands for the singapore arts museum
sam
oh singapore arts museum
yes alright
so you can tour another hour out there okay and this museum used to be located in an old school called saint joseph institution
yah
so these are the museums that's taken care of alright
and of course if you like some relaxation they have uh sauna and fitness centre
yes yes
alright in the hotel itself so you can do that
oh so they have that already in the hotel
yah they have a sauna and a fitness centre
okay
alright
yes
and again you know if you don't want to have breakfast in your hotel just outside your hotel there is an air-conditioned food court
so that's where we can try you know the authentic singaporean cuisine
yes it's air-conditioned so you have various kind of food like uh from chinese malay indian uh even philippines food
my uh
yah
oh really
yah
yes
that is all found in this food court
you know if you miss uh food there is one store there as well
that's great
oh yah
yah
so but of course you want to try some local food so i'll guess that
definitely we'll try um local food
and one of our local food that uh a lot of the local likes to do in the morning is we have what we called the kaya toast with coffee
kaya toast
kaya toast yah
so uh we have this bread with two uh soft boiled uh egg
alright and um at the bread we will put some kaya which is made of egg it's like egg custard
bread
oh egg custard
uh egg yah and coconut
so we call it kaya
oh okay
yah and yes you can have your coffee
so that's a very local breakfast
that's sounds delicious
yes
so that's what the local people do for breakfast
a lot of us
for breakfast
yah eat like that
and then you can go over to do your museums
yah
alright
and i would definitely also recommend going to sentosa island
sentosa island yah
so sound uh
so you saw the bayview hotel already on the screen
yes
yes
okay
alright so we can go to sentosa
sentosa
it's an island of the southern part of singapore
southern part
yah
okay and then i think you like uh swimming as well right
yes of course
okay
so you can do like a morning uh swim
yes
and since your friend like uh adventure we have the adventure park
yah
oh you have also adventure park that's good
yah
okay so this is something that you saw on the screen
oh you have zip-line there
oh she'll definitely love that
yes
yah
well you can spend like uh two hours there
oh yes
we have the parajump jungle trip alright
okay the prices are all uh stated there parajump is like per jump is fifteen dollars
all the prices i'm going to quote you will be in singapore dollars
oh yes okay
yah
and then yah
these are something that your friend would be keen to do
yes
yah i think she'll be interested with the parajump she likes heights
yah
and then we have the climbmax as well it's an aerial uh obstacle
okay you saw that on the screen now
yes
okay
so that would be
oh this climbmax is this one with the ropes
yah
oh okay
okay
so i think your friend will enjoy all these
see you saw this
yes
i think this
it's on the screen now
yes
yes
so i think she will get to enjoy herself um and let say if you or some of your other friends are not interested you can do so you can separate
you can some of them wants to do the adventure go to the adventure the rest were not so adventurous can do sunbathing or just have a swim in our lagoon
yes
okay so you can do the beaches
do you so in their beaches also do you have um like um scuba
do you do they al also offer scuba diving like that uh snorkelling
uh n no not in sentosa
no but in other parts you have
yah
yah
oh you also have a what's this this universal
yes we have uh universal studio as well
oh really
that's great
yah
yah this is you saw universal studio now on the screen
oh yah yes
yes
okay
uh so i will suggest like a whole day trip on sentosa
in sentosa
yah
so like your friends want to go adventure park they can do that
you will spend about one hour one and a half hours to two hours
then you go over to universal park
um yes
alright
so you can see uh you can do this so you'll probably spend about another half day on uh universal park
yes
is this where this um dolphin show is
yah
uh it's not open yet the dolphin thing uh but the uni uh right now if you want to see the dolphin show it's in another attraction but on sentosa itself
alright and that would be at the underwater world
oh underwater world
so what you do in the underwater world you go inside it's located like uh below the ground area
and you can go on this travel later that takes you around the whole underwater tank
so oh that's great
and they also have a dolphin show out there
um yah
okay
so okay you saw the universal now on this screen
yes
yes
yes
yah
so you can buy like a day pass
uh day pass
yeah
so that's like uh what
okay
it's cost an adult sixty eight dollars a day
oh the ticket
yah okay
yah
and that would be like uh weekday
okay
yah for weekend it will be about seventy two dollars
just a few dollars more
alright
yes
so uh that's universal studio of course lots of things to do there all the interesting ride like uh madagascar and they have this transformer ride i think that's thrilling as well
yes
okay
yah
so uh um we have to spend like um the whole day in sentosa for that right
uh i would say to four hours minimum
four hours okay
yah
because if you want to do some of the rides you know and the show
yes
so that's something you can do and let's say in the evening
uh huh in the evening
evening you can do uh we have actually another show it's called song of the sea
so that's like a play right
uh it's a play
uh it's water and laser and fire show
oh that's good
so
yah
oh yah
yah i've seen one here also that's very beautiful by the way
so you can do that you know
uh and then maybe you can have a late dinner
let's say you see the show at seven thirty seven forty and then you come out
you take the uh sentosa express it's a train on sentosa and you can have your dinner over at vivocity
yah
at
vivo
vivocity okay
yah
when you come out of the island it's on the south alright
and it's just about uh one km away there's this big wave like shopping centre called vivocity
uh it's so it's like a mall
yes it's a shopping mall there are lots of restaurants there
okay and if you don't like uh you can go over to clarke quay
okay
clarke quay
yah
clarke c l a r k e next word is q u a y
oh clarke quay yah
yah
so again there are lot restaurants out there uh and you can have your meal by the singapore river
um that's great
yah and you can have drinks
alright after your dinner you can have drinks there it is a very popular uh area for both singaporeans and tourists
so i think it uh the view there is much better at night than at day time
yes
uh of course it's not as hot and uh people come out to play so it's nice
but day time is also alright because at day it will be a little bit quieter
oh yah
yah
so there's a lot of uh people out in clarke quay
at okay
but it's not that crowded as in you know it's so crowded i mean it's just uh nice crowd out there
yes
so it's much it's a place where we can relax after the day right
yah you can just go and have drinks and some of the restaurants are in fact in singapore we don't dress up i would say we dress down
so it's alright if we were just in our usual clothes not really
yes
yah you don't really need to uh dress up
oh yah
yah
yah
clarke quay
alright
so i'm actually clipping for you the uh clarke quay area
clarke quay
oh that's beautiful
yah you saw
you saw the uh
yah you saw the restaurants by the bay
okay
so there are different uh uh restaurants out there
okay there are so many outlets out there
yah
oh so this
there you can see now uh the shape of clarke quay
yah
okay the blue part can you see the blue part
blue part yah this is water
yah that is the yes that's the singapore river
oh that's the singapore
okay
so you can have your meals you see all these red purple all these are restaurants
okay all these are restaurants here block d block e block a they are all restaurants out there
oh yah
i think it's nice to have a meal on one of that restaurants
yah
yah
and of course you must always try our signature singapore signature's food right
yes
so what can you suggest that um we should try
so we
okay
you can have our signature chili crab pepper crab in the seafood restaurants
yah so do try that and of course with some other dishes uh the other restaurant's recommendation but don't forget to try our signature food
yes definitely we'll do that
so uh most of um more uh most of the singaporean cuisines are seafoods right
yah
uh no we have a lot of other food as well it's just that i think a lot of people uh know about the uh chili crabs and pepper crabs because we uh the local love this food very much
oh i see
so that's just
and our and some of our other local food will be like um uh fried hokkien noodles
yah noodles
yah
yah prawn noodles
yes
uh if you like uh we have fried kway teow as well
okay uh otah things like this okay
but
yah okay
yah i think
and april okay april we still do have have you ever tried the durian
the what
durian the fruit
no durian yah we also have that here in the southern part
uh okay
do you like durian
yes
not very much
ah okay okay
so yah
so then i think uh we will just uh
bu but you have that also the durian
yah the local people like eat to eat this fruit very much
the
but it's really it taste good but it's just the smell
it's some kind of pungent
yah
alright right
okay
so i think that's fine
i think you can just try our chili crabs and pepper crab and it's fine to eat with your hands
yes
yes
we'll
even if you are in a restaurant it's fine you can just use your hands to eat them
yah
really
yah
so we eat with our hands in the restaurants
yes
oh yes
yah
and all the restaurants if you order this dish they always give you a bowl with water and lime or lemon in the water that's not for drinking it's for you to wash your hands
to wash the hands
yah
we might take it as a juice
yah
yah
yah just to warn you first you know that's not for drinking
yes yah
well yes thank you for warning me
yah
so you can try you can do that as well
and then the first day maybe do it take it easier you do a little bit of museum do a bit of shopping around your hotel area
yes
yes
yes
yes
uh there's a shopping mall called city hall
near the city hall also
okay that's great
yah in city hall there is shopping centre called raffles city
raffles city
raffles city
raffle
raffles
raffles r a f f l e s
ra raffles
oh raffles city
yah
so there all the shopping outlets there including mid-range to local brands to uh the luxury brands
yes
yah
uh and if you are still not tired you can go over to the underground shopping mall called citylink
yes
oh you have lower one also
yah
it's just from city hall
i think oh from city hall also
it's also near from city hall
okay
yah
yah
it's just uh inside in the basement area
oh in the ba
and from there you can walk to another shopping area called marina square
marina square oh
yah
yes so what can we uh what can we expect to see the marina square
is it much cheaper in the raffles city
than raffles city
i would say some of them have different uh outlets out there
uh and you can also from uh your hotel area you go over to our very famous shopping street called orchard road
you take the mrt
oh okay we take the mrt
yah
yah from dhoby ghaut or bras basah okay
uh and you go to this shopping street called orchard road it's just about three stop away from your uh hotel
okay
so every other building will be either a shopping mall or a hotel
okay
yah
so you can do a bit of shopping and also you can have your meals out there
yah
so again all the shopping mall will have a food court
okay so that they we won't go far more from um the shopping mall
so if we get tired we can already eat there right
yes or you can have a coffee or tea uh in a café in orchard road
orchard road
yah
orchard road
okay i'm just clicking out uh orchard road now
okay
okay can you see uh just a picture there on the right hand side
right hand side um
it's just one straight road
and ah it's just like a street then there are uh ma um stalls already there
yes
every other building on the street will be either a shopping mall or a hotel
oh i see
yah
so again you have luxury brand to uh mid-range to local brands and it's also fun to just do people watching out there on orchard road
so again you just can dress casual
casual oh yes
yeah
yah so
so aside from um shopping um what else can we do here in orchard road
uh you can do like people watching a bit of shopping you can do your coffee tea
uh spend about again yo again they all depends right
how much shopping do you want to do uh let say about two hours
okay then you do your uh museum
okay
yah
yah
okay
and i think maybe the first day you go for your chili crab at clarke quay that would be better
yah
so for
okay
yes
yah
so like first day a little bit of walking around uh and again if you want to do some uh yah i think that would be cover some of your first day
second day set off early early alright
yes
yah
second yes
yes
and then you go for your breakfast a little bit of swim your friend can do all the adventure thing
yah
so second uh um so um will you suggest that uh we do sentosa island on the second day
alright
yah
i will suggest that you do that on the second day
uh do a bit of uh the swim the adventure park afternoon you can go for your uh universal studio
yah
yes
it close at seven so you can stay till seven and then come out have your dinner
yes
so you can try a different cuisine now
uh first day you can do your chili crab second days i think most filipino's like spicy food right

that's great
yah so uh that's something you can do
yah so uh that's something you can do
alright so you just need
alright so you just need it's a small gallery about twenty minutes is sufficient
and then you can go to a local food centre because there were a lot of little uh food centres in toa payoh alright
just go to the one that's fairly crowded
yah
yes
if you don't know what to order just look at what people are eating and just ask them which store they order from
yes
yah
we'll do that
alright
yah so you'll get to well uh interact with our local so it becomes a little bit more interesting
yah
and so you can do that for half day
yes
okay
uh and i guess afternoon you may want to do some spa
yah
uh yah
or you can do your uh again we do have spas around your hotel area there are quite a few spas located there
in all the shopping centre there'll be a spa there
yes
so aside from the one at the hotel uh there are also lot of spas um near the hotel
yah
right
okay
yes
there are also quite a few so you can do that and i think that will cover your second day already
yes
okay
and i would say the third day you can visit the botanical gardens
oh botanical gardens
that yah we'll love to see that
yah
so that is located just off uh orchard road
orchard road yah
yah
you can easily spend about two hours
two hours
okay you can see now the botanical gardens
hm not yet
oh yes
can you see now
okay
yes
alright so
oh it's beautiful
so we got see um different species of plants here that are endemic in singapore only or do you have also plants from other countries
the plants is it
yes
no we do have but uh actually the highlight of the botanical gardens would be uh the orchids
the
orchids
okets
yes
so what are the okets
orchids the orchids plants
uh o r c h i d s orchids
o
o r
o r
c h
oh orchids
orchids yes
so that is actually uh the highlight of this uh garden
oh yah
so
see can you see national orchid garden
um not yet
also you have um a lot different species of orchids here
yes
oh that's
and it's so beautiful out there
yes
alright
and they open early as early as eight thirty in the morning to seven
it's uh yes
so admission for one adult is five dollars
five dollars yes
yah
oh i think we're gonna get a lot of pictures here
yes because every other spot is a picture spot
yes
okay
so try to do that in the morning when it's not so hot
uh huh yes
yah
and
so aside from the orchids um are there any more plants that are showcased
like you know um plants that are just um endemic for in singapore like plants that are just found um in singapore
just in singapore okay
some of the orchids are cultivated here uh but of course we export our orchids
in fact singapore is the world third uh largest exporter of orchids
yah
wow
yes
so we have like plants uh orchids plants that are specially cultivated here
hm that's great
and we get to see that yah
yah
yes
yes in the national orchid garden in the singapore botanic gardens
yah
yes
oh that's fun
yah
and if you are let's say planning a trip there on a sunday we normally have some free uh shows in the garden in the evening at six o'clock
oh shows
yah
so what do they do in these shows
it all depends uh we have it uh once a month in the just outside the national orchid garden there is like a slope
uh so it depends
it can be a jazz concert it can be uh uh quintet it can be singing alright
yah
so it all depends on what is available what is uh planned for that particular sunday
and you can always pack your picnic basket with wine and just sit and with your mat alright
just sleep or sit over there
yes
yes
i think
yes
so that would be the evening time already
yes
and then
so
okay then sa let's say if you are doing the morning garden alright
then you can have your lunch again you know anywhere you like either in orchard road and you can plan a trip to chinatown
yes
oh you have also chinatown there
yes because uh you know traditionally we do have ethnic area in singapore so we have like uh chinatown little india and kampong glam
yes
chinatown
yah
so again you can take the subway to go there
subway again
yes
so
and then we just um from the subway we just um walk to chinatown
yes
uh it's actually we have a station called chinatown station
i
okay
otherwise the closest east-west line would be the tanjong pagar
and you can walk about ten minutes walk
you can visit
ten minutes walk
yah
or you can visit one of our oldest chinese temple called th
oh really
yah called thian hock keng temple
yah
so that's a buddhist temple right
uh yes it's a buddhist taoist and confucianism
taoist
okay
so can you see now the picture of chinatown
hm not yet
okay
oh yah i can see it now
yah
okay chinatown
oh so
alright yah
yah so you can see this cup of coffee just now
uh hm yes
okay the first china town
so the so there are um we can see um um we can go shopping here also and dine
so this is an old building right
yah these are all old building which has been restored
so in the old days where the people from all over the world when they came to singapore they like to live in this area which is near the singapore river
um and eventually it gets very crowded so people move away from this area and it became just the chinese area
people ca uh a lot of chinese live here because they work
so only the chinese were left in this area that's why it's called chinatown now
uh i would say there are minority races who live here but majority who were left here were the chinese they live here
oh yes
right
so in the old days they live on the second floor or third floor ground floor was used a shop but today we used the ground floor as shops
second and third level uh we mainly used them as either a store room or uh office
so it's quite nice to walk around
yes
yes
i noticed that um the buildings they have um huge windows
yes
oh yes
okay this because in the past there were no air-condition uh so they the architects i would say are pretty uh creative right
they make the big windows which is actually well we learned from uh the europeans alright uh to have big windows
yes
yes
oh so so these big windows are european influences right
yah they are influences uh from europe and when you see in the past when you open up fully you can get more ventilation into the house
and right in the centre there's actually an air well
yes
air well
yah
air well that means it's an open space that goes up to the top of the building and it's not covered
yes
so that's like the ventilation so that uh the ventilation of the air so that it's too hot inside
because correct yah
so uh uh the front is narrow but it's pretty long so they need to have some ventilation as well as light coming into the house
uh so these are the china town houses
and if you go to china town do look out for this green colour roof that looks like bamboo
oh yes green colour
yah
yah because uh according to the chinese the bamboos represents uh long life
oh really
bamboos they represent
yeah
so this yah
so these are the uh peculiar uh features of the chinatown houses
and also do look out for outside the houses there are engravings like phoenixes flowers uh on the outside of the houses
so these
but it's just above the green roof on the first level there are usually some engravings out there
okay
yah
so it's nice to walk around
you can go for foot massage over in chinatown
you can have a chinese tea appreciation in chinatown as well
okay
so do spend about one hour if you plan to have your chinese tea appreciation
with some uh so-called small bites you know like titbits kind of uh thing
alright
yeah
so there are few like uh chinese tea appreciation uh places in chinatown itself
so they also have that like um do they also perform like um tea ceremony like that
a tea what
a tea ceremony
just like you know in japan right
they have tea ceremonies
oh okay
okay
our tea appreciation is not as elaborate as the japanese uh but our tea if you are going to have your tea in the chinese uh tea houses the tea comes in they are being served in small little cups
so uh the owners or the server would be able to assist you as to how we drink or appreciate this chinese tea
appreciate yes
yah because you have to go a few rounds
the first round is to warm up the cups uh then the first cup where you take is uh for you to smell the tea and later on you drink this tea
so you sip you don't drink the whole cup
it's all very little cups you know it's like uh what the cups would look like the kind of uh toys when we are small we used to play with this little cups it looks that small
yes
yes
okay
so they the cups used are just very small
yah it is a small cup so it's actually appreciation
so you smell it first and then you sip slowly and meanwhile you know you sort of uh chit chat with your friends
so it's very relaxing uh in this kind of tea houses
yes
okay
and of course at the same time you can order some small uh uh bites alright but of course it will be more chinese related kind of uh food like snacks
yah okay
so i think um that would be the last itinerary right
yes
and of course if you can go to the airport early you can always do shopping out in the airport your last minute shopping because there's so many shops in the airport even in the transit area
yes
yes
okay
so okay thank you so much for helping me out um plan my um stay there in singapore
welcome
okay your welcome
yes
alright
okay bye
okay
okay
bye
bye
hi good morning
hi good morning
uh this is uh tour guide one
my name is lynnette
and can i get your name
yah hi lynnette
this is lorraine
lorraine is it
no it's lorraine
oh lorraine sorry
yah
okay lorraine
uh how can i plan for your trip in singapore
yah actually i'm planning a trip to singapore
uh we're just two people i mean me and my partner
uh huh
uh and then we have a budget of one thousand dollars
maybe you can help me out on this
okay
so like one thousand per person
hm yah
okay
uh right now i think the conversion is one singapore dollars will give you approximately about thirty four pesos
okay
yah
so whatever price that i'm gonna quote you will be all in singapore dollars
oh great
yah
okay
okay so it's there and how many days will you be spending in singapore
about one to two days only
oh one or two days only yah
yup
okay and is there anything in peculiar that you would like to do here
yah actually i have something in mind
i want something um that me and my partner weren't tried
but at the same time we want something um which is a bit historical wherein we can learn something about your culture your traits and you know different places wherein we can remember singapore at all times
okay
alright
okay so you want to do something historical and uh this is your first time in singapore
yah
okay
alright
uh what we can do is one or two days
alright now uh you will arrive in changi airport
alright
and you can take the subway
okay
we call ours mrt and i think in philippines you call it the same as well
yah
eh okay
uh all the signs the street signs will all be written in english
so you will have no problem uh getting on the subway or travelling around singapore either by bus or the subway
okay great
yah
so the subway station and changi airport is called changi airport
alright
and you will take the east west line
east west line okay
it's the green line
okay
uh if it's like a one day you can buy a standard ticket but if it's for two days you can uh either buy a standard ticket or you can buy the tourist ticket
okay is there any price difference between those tickets
oh okay it's just that the standard uh the stored value ticket will be easier for you to travel around but there's actually a five dollars uh deposit
okay
uh standard ticket let's say assuming if the price is like a dollar you have to prepare two dollars
at the end of your trip you just remember to go back to the machine and you'll be able to get the uh refund of that one dollar
okay that's great
yah
so i'll just show you in brief uh the map
alright
i okay
uh of uh of the subway train
okay
yah can you see now
hm no not yet
are you able to see now
no
this is okay
alright can you i think you should be able to see
okay so on the right-hand side where you see the number three
yah
yes
okay
that is changi airport
yah the green line right
yes the green line
okay
you have to get off the train at expo
okay
and you will continue with the green line
okay
uh and i guess the age-wise uh you're between twenty to thirties
okay
alright
you can get off at there are few hotels that you can choose from
okay
okay that is uh one of well it's quite a new hotel now called v hotel
v as in victory
just a v
letter v
yah
new hotel
okay
it's at lavender mrt
okay
okay so that's one hotel that you can choose
the next hotel will be at bugis
bugis okay
the next station
uh that's called landmark hotel
landmark
yah
okay
and then if you go to the yellow line just follow the green line up
okay
the yellow line
yah
that's another word called bras basah
yah
okay
there's another hotel there called the uh uh bayview hotel
oh okay
okay
so these are all uh budget range hotel
but i will chose these view hotels because they are very convenient in terms of uh walking
okay
to your the places of interest
have you any idea which um the three of them is the best one
uh best
for a couples
best as in
uh when it comes to um services facilities and everything
alright
okay
uh the three hotels they do have um breakfast they have uh fitness centre and also they have swimming pool uh and sauna as well
alright
so i would say that they are fairly uh compatible
compatible
uh but the one at lavender that would be quite a new hotel because they have just opened recently
oh okay
alright
yes
okay
but if you want to be like very near to the main shopping area walk to the museum
yah
then i would say that the one closer to bras basah would be better
oh okay that's great
so i think and uh i'll be choosing that one
okay
so uh that would be the bayview hotel
okay
you just cross like the first day you can do a museum tour
okay
okay just cross across from the hotel and you are at the national uh museum of singapore
oh cool
so i just need to walk
alright
yes you just need to walk
okay
alright
so what you do is you just walk you can spend easily
alright few hours in the museum
uh but i would say a minimum stay of one hour to two hours
okay cool
yah
so you go in to the newest part of the museum
yah
and alright um okay
this is our museum area
you can see on the left-hand side this glass area
yah
okay
you go in from the older part of the museum you go into the newer part of the museum
but inside this gallery
okay
inside this gallery itself you'll be able to learn about the history of singapore right through from the early nine hundreds to modern day singapore
oh okay
cool yah
hm you can use the audio guide
we have we do provide audio guides for you
so do remember to uh check out the audio guides
alright
so it's self-explanatory
and you can do like uh a one hour inside this history gallery
oh okay
um are all things there written in english too or any translation
were in
yes it's in english
uh okay
yes in english
so you can do this um uh tour
alright
and if you have time you go back to the older part of the museum
we have living galleries in there
but if you don't have then that's fine
just cover the history part
yah
okay
okay
now after this so you can do this in the morning
yah
okay have your lunch in our many hawker centre
okay there's just one just outside your hotel area
okay
what do they serve
okay they have various kinds of food
like chinese food indian food malay food and we even have fish and chips out in our hawker centre
oh cool
now one meal uh will cost you with drinks in the range of eight singapore dollars
okay
so that means like if you have rice with three dishes uh and a drink
yah that's approximately about eight dollars
okay i understand
alright
alright
yah
then from there you can take the mrt
to uh chinatown
chinatown okay
what can i see in chinatown
yah
okay because you would have a good idea of the history of singapore
generally people came here from all over the world
okay
uh because they were looking for jobs out here
uh huh
in the early days
uh so the chinese came the malays from nearby the malay archipelago
uh the indians from southern part of india
the arabs
uh okay
and the europeans of course they came and
yes
in the beginning all of them live in this place called chinatown
uh okay
so
alright
okay
but eventually it gets crowded so the uh they moved away from this area
okay
so the chinese stayed back in chinatown
then the malays moved to this area called kampong glam
okay
and the indians moved to this area called little india
uh okay
so they have different uh separate places now
yes so what we have done is we have preserved all these ethnic areas
yes so you can actually do chinatown first in the afternoon
that means you can also have your lunch uh in chinatown
there's also a non-air conditioned food court uh in chinatown itself
okay
okay
so you alight at chinatown mrt train station
okay
um there are some other cafes there as well if you want to do your cafes
walk around chinatown
okay so appreciate the architecture
pick up a bit of uh souvenirs from chinatown area
uh okay
if i'm going there this um end of march can uh will i ever see any festivities in chinatown
do they have any festival right now
okay
okay uh not in april
we do have a big festival in chinatown
that would be in uh january period
january
yes
but it's okay it's still very um uh a nice walk around chinatown because the houses there are preserved
alright they are under conservation status
so the front part of the buildings are all preserved already
so
okay
uh oh okay
so there are really ancient um architectural designs there
okay
yah
there are yah uh i would say we also learnt from the europeans
oh okay
because you will see big windows
which allows air to ventilate the whole area
oh okay
so that will be their means of ventilation for that house or for that particular building
yah because in the old days their houses were not air conditioned
alright
so uh you can actually see uh uh okay that's another view of chinatown
alright
oh okay
oh
that's cool
yes
so uh you can visit this on the right-hand side there's a buddha relic hotel uh temple
oh yes
it's a chinese temple
okay
okay
uh right
can you see chinatown visitor centre
you can pay a visit to this chinatown centre
yes
yah
and again if you like to really learn more about the people in chinatown how what kind of conditions they were living in
uh just about two street away there is a chinatown heritage centre
uh okay
so you can visit there as well and to see how people in the past they lived in this very cram condition in chinatown
so like one house will be divided into various cubicles and you can have easily uh fifty people living in just one house on one level
oh really
yes so that's something very uh unique i would say
uh of course we don't live like this anymore but this was how the uh poor people the coolies the labourers the rickshaw riders they used to live in chinatown
uh okay
and
alright
yah
but uh what if i wanted to visit a buddha temple
is it okay
is there any rule that i need to follow because i'm not a buddhist
yah it's no problem
this buddha relic temple is open to the public
uh just make sure that you are uh dressed properly
like uh no short skirt no shorts
uh if you are wearing culotte just you know have it like uh touching the knee below the knee
if you are wearing like t-shirt try to be get uh wear a t-shirt that has sleeve and you'll be fine
okay
okay that's great
okay
uh if you are if you should really want to wear short it's still fine
because at the front of the buddha relic temple they do provide scarfs for you to put on
uh but i would say dressing-wise as in any other place of worship just uh this would be uh good enough
alright
okay
thank you for that
yah
and just down the road uh i think we can do that just uh buddha relic temple
but if you really want to see another chinese temple then you have to walk to the uh temple called thian hock keng temple
that's about uh fifteen minutes walk away from here
okay
yah
so you can do this
alright
do a little bit of lunch
a bit of souvenir shopping
appreciate the architecture because the architecture here would be different from the ones in kampong glam and little india
oh okay i see now
uh so do look up
you know you i think you can see just above the flowers there are this green coloured roof uh that looks like bamboo plants
yah
yah
okay so this is the architecture would be different from the houses in kampong glam and little india
uh okay
um is it because it's made up of wood and the one that we have in little india is made up of that is that a difference
uh no the difference uh it just looks like uh bamboo plants they are made of ceramic
alright
uh and because the chinese according to the chinese the bamboos represents uh bamboo
alright look they look bamboo and according to the chinese bamboo means everlasting or long life
okay
uh okay
i thought they are real bamboos
yah
no this is uh uh no they are not real bamboos
they are made of ceramic tiles
uh it's just that they are made to look like bamboos
hm okay
so the bamboos according to the chinese are auspicious uh symbol
okay
okay so you will don't you will not see this kind of roof over in kampong glam and little india
uh okay
alright
okay so after your walk in chinatown i could guess that would be about two p.m
you can go over to uh little india
little india okay
yah
so you take the subway train again that happens to be the correct line
so you will alight at uh little india
yah
okay
and again it's very straightforward the main road of little india is serangoon road
serangoon okay
serangoon i'll spell it for you
s e r
a n g o o n
yah
serangoon
yes serangoon
is that correct
yes correct
okay
okay so it's just one main street
and out of this main street you can go to the little streets
so if you are lost you just go back to the main street again
okay yah
yah
and then i'll see the uh subway train again
so yes when you get up from the chinatown
chinatown same station you take the same line and you alight at little india
yah
oh okay
that's great
yah
okay
so you will alight at the station called little india
when you come out of the station but just remember that most of our subway or rather all our subway train station have a few exit
you just come out to the exit that is towards uh little india uh arcade
okay but uh there would be a sign i mean a sign
yah with signage
yes
yes signage or someone whom i can ask about it
okay i might get lost
right
in all yes
in all our mrt train station there's always a station master
so uh you just approach uh the station master and anyway the signs are all quite clear
so just alight uh i mean just come out from the right side of the mrt train station
uh huh
okay no problem
thank you
okay
and then at the uh so the main area will be what we call the little india arcade
okay
it's not a games arcade
it's just so-called the little india arcade
okay then you can do a walk because it's the whole atmosphere is totally different from chinatown
you will see quite a few flower garland shop
uh because the indians uh like flowers because it represents the way of life
yes
and of course they use uh they buy the indians buy them or rather the hindus uh they buy them and offer the flower garlands to uh their gods when they go to visit the uh temples
uh okay
alright
yes
okay
so yes so you can you will see like flower garland shop
you will see um shops selling vegetables
what was that again
i'm sorry
vegetables
like a market but they are like stand alone shops
hm okay
and they don't have this in the chinatown right
uh they do have a market
uh if you go back to now i'm still showing the chinatown
yah
i'm still showing the chinatown visitor uh complex
just on the left hand side there is a food centre
in the basement of the food centre is a market
oh okay
okay but uh so it's like a wet market
a wet market it means the floor is perpetually wet
okay
so they sell meat vegetable fruits flowers everything is sold there
but that close at twelve p.m
yah
oh okay
alright
so uh if you want to do a market you can do that
and then take a trip to little india
okay
so take a trip on the subway to little india
now in little india the houses are a little bit different
like i mentioned you will not see uh houses with this green roof
yes
the houses in little india will be a little bit more simpler in design
compared to the ones in chinatown
okay
yah
yah
and
so uh take a walk around uh little india and uh soak in the atmosphere out there
the sari shop
very colourful sari shop
and of course do try the indian pancake called uh roti prata
yah
okay
there's also north indian food called chapati
and do you have any idea how much it will cost uh eat i will eat in little india
your eating in little india it's not very expensive
uh about eighty cents for a piece of plain roti prata
oh really
yah
and you can also have this bread called naan
uh huh
or you can have chapati which is made from wheat flour
yes
okay
okay
alright
so you can eat with your hands
uh okay
if you eating this kind of food
okay nobody will give you funny looks
okay
alright
and uh of course if you want to buy some sari
the cheapest one would be in the range that's made of poster would be in the range of singapore dollars ten dollars
okay
and you can wear with uh short uh blouse
yah
alright
okay so this is uh
if you can see on the map can you see the word serangoon road on the right-hand side
serangoon road
yes
yah
you can see uh so that is the whole the main road of uh little india
okay
then you can see all the little road that leads out from serangoon road
yah
okay
so you will be doing um can you see the word campbell lane
yup
okay
oh uh there is this a lot of activities can be found over there
you can do uh henna painting on your hands
okay
uh the you know when you first apply it were it's black in colour but it takes about half an hour to dry
when it starts to crack you will just scrape off
leave this orange uh a stain on your hands it probably last you about seven days
okay
okay
so the indians lady do the henna painting like right now for special occasions when they get married for special uh festival but otherwise you can do henna painting any time
okay
and um do they have these designs for me or i will be the one whose going to give them a design
or i just need to choose a you know a typical design wherein they it's like a tradition from them
uh no they do have uh traditionally of course it's just uh flowers or geometric design
flowers mainly
so they do have uh patterns for you to choose
uh huh
oh okay
yah the artist are pretty good
they can just come out
they can draw for you within like uh less than five minutes and they are done
okay that's cool
okay
and you get about uh okay i just want to show you some of the scene
in chinatown uh in little india this one here
okay
okay
and the next one is food
do you like colourful food
yup
okay
uh one of the typical indian food is called indian rojak
rojak
rojak will be that means like everything mixed together
so you can choose what you like uh from potatoes to egg to meat
okay it's a combination of everything
yes so you choose what you like
uh that they are usually quite colourful and they serve you in this orange looking uh sauce
and the next one will be the flower garland shop that i just talked about
uh okay
are all this food spicy and
okay
you know uh are all of them spicy
no not really
okay like the um uh indian rojak for example
uh the sauce is not that spicy
just a little bit spicy but if you don't like spicy food you can actually skip the sauce
uh okay
uh for the naan of course it's not spicy it's made of uh wheat flour
roti prata they are all made of flour
and if you again don't like spicy food then you skip the uh curry
well some of our younger children they do eat roti prata with sugar but that's not very traditional
uh huh
oh okay
yah
or if you again don't you don't like spicy food is it
not really
okay
so you can also have your roti prata or your chapati with dhal
okay it's a sauce called dhal
it's made from beans so it's not spicy
uh okay
so i just need to request this from the salesman
yes
so instead of getting curry you ask for dhal
okay
alright
it's dhal
okay
okay
dhal yah
and uh that's also a typical food in little india
yah i think these are quite typical food already in little india
okay and you can have a drink
called lassi l a s s i
okay lassi
it's it is taste a little bit like yogurt
yogurt
so is it
taste a little bit like yogurt
okay
it's made up of what
okay but okay it's made up of yogurt
alright
uh but they have added in like the modern uh taste would be you can have mango lassi
oh okay so
alright
there are all the different kind of fruits uh that's added into this uh yogurt drink
okay that's very interesting
so it's a typical yah it's a typical indian drink
okay and i just need to choose what kind of fruit i wanted to uh mix with this lassi
right
okay
okay
so a meal in uh food centre would cost you about with the uh lassi
about eight dollars
hm okay that's cheap
okay
now so you can walk around little india i gave you a few images for you to see
and then you can go on to do kampong glam
kampong glam
okay
yah
so remember earlier on i said about the different races that used to live in singapore and later it was so crowded they all moved away to different parts of singapore
yah
so if you're really done your museum tour that will be a good way to see uh you know how the people you uh live in these different areas
uh huh
okay so the people in little india in the past they used to engage in cattle related activities
okay
like uh milking of cows
oh okay
so again if you look at the map there are roads named after buffalos
right there's a buffalo road
oh yah
okay there is if you walk look up a bit it's called there's another road called kerbau road
that's also named after buffalos or cows
oh okay
that's malay but okay
so from our street names you can actually tell what kind of activities people in the past used to engage in
okay that's great
alright
so you walk a little bit down serangoon road you will come to this uh sri veeramakaliamman temple
yah
so from there uh in the afternoon the in the afternoon the temple is closed but you still can get good photograph of the exterior part of the temple
uh hm okay
take some good pictures
yah
and then you just walk to farrer park just walk straight
again you'll come to the mrt called farrer park mrt
yup
and then take a train to kampong glam but you have to change train
oh okay
alright
so uh if you are not too tired
alright
so otherwise you can reserve kampong glam for the next day
uh okay it's
because you'll be doing chinatown little india in the first day
so like some of the other souvenirs that you may want to pick up in little india would be like bangles
you can buy bangles for a dollar each
for a dollar of uh a dollar for a few of these plastic bangles
okay
sari if it's not too elaborate about singapore dollars ten dollars onwards
uh okay it's okay
yah
so some shop here they get your henna painting done
yah so that's about five dollars
uh okay
for one hand yah
okay
okay
so these are the things you want to do then you proceed on either the same day or the next day you go to kampong glam
if i wanted to go to kampong gam at the same day is there any um thing i can see at night
okay you try to reach the let's say uh it's still very busy i would say in the night time because there are lot of nice cafe out there
okay
so there is a night market
okay
uh no night market in kampong glam but there are a lot of cafes and of course the highlight would be the sultan mosque
what would that be
okay
okay it's a mosque so uh again you have to be appropriately dressed
okay
for a visit to the mosque
uh but again if you want to visit the mosque you try to time your timing let's say before 4:30
okay
alright
so you can visit the mosque but just before the prayer hall
hm okay
okay so have a look it's a bit different from churches you don't see chairs inside the prayer hall
uh have a look alright
and then just outside the mosque there's a street it's a walking a pedestrian mall called the bussorah mall
okay
alright
some of the again like the architecture take a look it's quite different from the little india as well as chinatown houses
there are subtle differences
this is the modern one
no they are all traditional and conservation houses
oh
alright so we have uh seen little india right
yah
now proceed to kampong glam
okay
because um as i could see they have uh very um different architectural designs
oh okay
i would say subtle differences
subtle differences
okay now yes
you are actually seeing um a white house this used to be the sultan palace but they are now undergoing uh restoration
okay
alright
so uh glam is actually named after a tree by the name of the glam tree
they used to grow abundantly around this area because they used to be uh just next to the sea
hm so the boats when they come here for trading they stop there
and these trees are pretty useful like if there's a small leak on the boat they can use uh the bark of the tree to repair the small little hole
uh the leaves can be used to make medicine and the bark the fibres of the tree can be used to make baskets
oh okay
so this tree is very useful
alright
yah we don't get to see a lot of this tree but they are still available
okay
okay so i'll see i'll show you now a map of uh kampong glam
okay but you don't need to do the whole thing
you can just do the small part alright
okay
it's because it's just if you have ony one hour that's still fine
so you just walk around this certain street and i like to introduce you to if you remember the white building that i showed you that's uh the sultan palace
yes
okay just on outside there's a street called kandahar street
okay
okay
uh and this street has beautiful architecture
oh okay
okay
so okay and just spend a bit of time just outside the mosque there's a bussorah uh mall
you can pick up some traditional games and i think you have played them before possibly when you were young like five stone
okay yah
uh so some of these traditional games uh you can pick them up
the it's like about a dollar each for these kind of toys
yes
okay
and then you can walk to um uh haji lane
they are just one street away from each other
uh huh
and you can have your dinner there
so we have like mediterranean food
so uh i would say sorry uh mid-eastern kind of uh food
uh so you can just pick whichever cafes that you like
okay that's great
so i can have my dinner there
yah
yah and then you can have drinks and you can even try this uh shisha
shisha
it's water pipes
which are very popular in the arab countries
yah
yah
so these are some interesting things that you want to do
and of course if you want to try out belly dancing as well
bel okay
yah
so you can also do that in kampong glam
so there are belly dancers there
yah
so you can just join them
yah you can watch their performance
you can join them or you can even take a short course on belly dancing
okay that's great
okay
so these are the things you want to do like either the whole day or you can reserve next day for uh kampong glam
okay no problem
okay
so i think uh that's about what you can do within one to two days right
yes
and of course don't forget a little bit of uh shopping or people watching in orchard road
because you are just staying very near
uh just one to two station away from orchard road
okay
okay and then of course we have the gst the seven percent uh tax rebate
if you buy above a hundred dollars from the same shop
oh okay that's great
and which has this sign that says the gst
gst
like small little shops they will not be gst uh registered so you won't get back your tax refund
oh okay
so i just need to go to store which is registered or i'll and they are um registered to the government
they offer gst
no what you do is let's say you are buying from a big shop right
is that
so uh you just tell them you want a gst form they will give it to you
you just fill it up at the airport when you're leaving singapore
just make sure that you get it stamped
uh and when once you clear the immigration you can get back your money
oh
in whatever currency you want
okay that's wonderful
so it's only available with big shops right
yah the bigger shop that has this gst sign
the small little shops they will not be gst uh registered so they will not be able to uh give you the gst form
okay i understand
so um
okay
can you also uh help me if i wanted to uh go to a place wherein i can relax
something like a beach
do you have anything um where that wherein i can just visit the seashore
near to um my hotel
okay
uh what we can do is because we don't have like fine sand in our uh on the mainland
okay
uh the nicer beach will be on sentosa island
otherwise you if you don't want we have a beach that if you don't have to go the sentosa island then it will be on the east coast
and um it will take me about an hour or
how long do i need to travel from my um hotel to get there
okay you can take the uh subway train
yup
uh or you can take bus thirty six
alright to go to the east coast area
yah
uh and just have a sunbathe and just relax or just have a little bit of swim
uh bring a picnic basket uh to the east coast
oh okay that's great
so i can spend there the whole afternoon before i leave uh singapore
right
and it's also quite close to the airport
oh really
so i can just bring my things there before i leave
yah
yah but it maybe a bit troublesome right
because you have to bring your luggage and all that there
yah
okay so i suggest that if you still have time you know like the second day just relax and then come back pick up your luggage and then go to the airport
uh okay
do they have the spas there
the what
the spa
the spa in east coast uh not in the east coast area they don't have the spa out there
so our spa will be found mainly uh in the shopping centre
okay uh yah
and the hotels
some of the hotels do offer spa
oh okay
alright
sure
no problem
so i hope i had been helpful to you
yah
you had really gave me um ideas what i you know when i get there the things that i'll do
by the way do you have months wherein you celebrate several festival
i wanted to see some you know um different
sorry you
if do you have uh what kind of month do you have this um celebration of festivals
uh okay we have the different uh festivals that's celebrated in singapore
but uh if you are coming in april okay
april we don't have a major festival
in the month of april
but oh okay
but um usually you uh what month do you celebrate your festivals
okay we have uh depending on the year uh chinese new year usually january where we have this major festival in chinatown
uh september would be the mooncake festival
hari raya some time in august
and deepavali was be some time in october
what would be the events for the uh this mooncake festival
the event would be
you will see a lot of shops selling this cake that is round
okay
it looks like the moon
okay so this is celebrated by the chinese people
uh hm okay
it's appreciation of the moon i would say this festival
appreciation of the moons
yah there are of course legends associated with this mooncake festival
okay and uh they also have this lantern festival
yes it's actually uh mooncake and together it's the lantern festival
so we will eat mooncake the children will carry lanterns
uh and just walk around where they live
oh okay
this happen for just a whole day or it happen for a week
do you have this celebration for a week
yah we do have like in our housing estate the children can actually walk around with a lantern but otherwise it's only for a particular day
it should be somewhere in september
oh okay
how about
yah but yah but anyway throughout this whole month you'll see a lot of shop selling this mooncake
a lot of shops will be selling the lanterns uh as well
so you get this uh mooncake uh kind of festival mood throughout the whole month
hm okay
yah
so they have this parade as well
you know uh i saw on tv that they have this um parade of buddha
is it the one um yah
is it the one celebrated in the mooncake festival too
parade of buddha
uh no usually the mooncake uh we just have mooncakes to eat and the children will carry or even the adults carry lanterns uh that's about it for the lantern festival
uh okay
okay
yah
alright
okay um could you also please uh give me a bit description about this uh festival about the nine emperor gods
okay this is uh not like a nationwide festival
uh oh
okay you know the chinese have so many different gods
so this is just a festival that is celebrated
we have a temple in somewhere in the eastern part of singapore
yah
yah
yah uh so basically it's one of these gods uh uh festival that's about it
so the chinese will offer food and offering uh to the gods
oh okay
so usually people just offer uh foods to the gods
food and offering
yah that's right for the particular god's birthday
okay that's the only activity for this uh day
uh if you are going to the temples in the eastern part of singapore then yes they are it's quite uh festive
you'll see a lot of people offering prayers
uh otherwise it is not like a nationwide kind of uh festival
the major festival would be like chinese new year
the chinese
deepavali hari raya and christmas eve
that's our major festival
and
chinese new year if you are down in january feb uh january period
uh again very festival-like because we have a lot more shop selling chinese new year cookies uh decorations so it's a very kind of a festive mood
oh okay
uh yah
then hari raya would be again very festive but it will be either in kampong glam or another area called geylang
again people are selling food associated with the celebration of hari raya
uh people are buying new clothes
uh for the whole family to wear when they visit one another
uh deepavali quite similar to the other two festivals
and of course christmas time in december we decorate all the buildings along orchard road right up to the marina square
yah
oh okay
so the major um one of the major uh festival that you have is uh the chinese new year right
i think uh uh chinese new year hari raya deepavali and christmas that's where everybody celebrate
the this is where oh okay
yah
okay
so um september we don't really have a ma uh sorry april we don't really have a major festival but uh good friday it's uh our pub one of our public holidays here
okay
but uh do you have any um activities and any other activities um within the month of april like a summer day you know wherein i can enjoy anything under the sun
summer day
uh we don't have a summer day but because uh well we are in the equator so it's summer throughout the whole year
uh no major festival like i said in uh april
hm okay
so uh but otherwise it's still busy
alright we are still busy and we still have a lot of tourist coming in throughout the whole year
so you still get this very festival uh mood in singapore
oh okay i think uh yah
i understand
now thank you so much
yah
okay bye
okay have a great day bye
okay bye
hi good afternoon
hello
hi uh this is uh tour guide one
uh and my name is lynnette
hello i am participant number four my name is lorena
hi lorena
hello
hello
um i'm planning to make a visit on singapore and i'm wondering if you can help me out to make my stay memorable
okay sure and uh when do you plan to come to singapore
well actually i'm planning to go there may on may twenty six twenty seven
okay just for two days
yes two days
and uh would you be coming with any other people
yes
i'll be coming with my husband because it's his birthday and i'm planning to give him a surprise
okay
yes and i promised him to have a tour in singapore but that was um like two years ago and i think this is the right time that i can um give that promise to him
hm okay
so it's a birthday treat
yes
alright
is there
and how many days were you be spending here
i think um two to three days
okay
and is there anything in particular that your husband would like to see
hm honestly nothing in particular because uh all we uh just love to do is to shop eat and just travel and um make sure to uh see all the beautiful places in singapore. but
just travel and um make sure to uh see all the beautiful places in singapore. but
by the way uh what's the number one um tourist place in singapore
number one
yes
uh right now i would say sentosa
does he like to see uh wildlife as well
um yes he will definitely love that
but um i'm hearing a lot about sentosa
um i think that will be great if i'll be able to visit there also
ah okay
okay
and does he like a little bit of relaxation or more adventure
um i think we will love both because we want to relax and
maybe on the first day we can um have some adventures like um what you have told me to uh visit wildlife and other stuffs but i also love to have relaxation maybe on the second day or the third day
right okay
so uh what you can do is because just now you also mentioned to uh look around singapore
yes
so what i will suggest is uh the first day you could do a little bit of sightseeing and uh also include either our zoo and night safari for first day and second day sentosa
uh third day with a little bit of shopping um and relaxation
how does that sound to you
that sounds great
um by the way um i have uh one thousand singaporean dollars um budget for the tour
will that be uh sufficient for the two of us or we need to uh have additional budget
okay
uh i think it's quite fine with a thousand dollars it's actually quite fine
okay
you can actually make do with that uh in singapore
and uh coming in from the airport uh
do you have any uh hotel in mind
none
not at all
yes not at all
we're still um if you can suggest some hotel that we can stay that will be very helpful for us
right
okay uh there are quite a number of places that you can stay
uh and it's quite easy to get around using the subway trains we call it the mrt out here
ah okay
so that is uh the mrt from changi is on the east it is a green line
okay
and um it is fairly easy
uh you buy a standard ticket
so you just look for the place that you are uh that the location that you will be alighting and then the price will be flashed on the screen and you just pay accordingly
so what i will suggest is uh change some singapore money at the airport either inside the transit hall or just outside after your collection of the bags there are money changer there
okay
so you just change some small singapore money like uh a dollar coins two dollars notes and five dollars note to help just to uh for your travelling needs on the subway and to try out some local food
okay
uh do you mean if i take if we took the subway it can take us to anywhere in singapore
yes almost anywhere in singapore
almost anywhere
yah
so we have like uh from changi airport is the east to the west line
so if you take all the way you come to the west that's jurong
then we have another line the red colour line that's north to the south or south to the north line
and then we have a purple line uh that goes from the uh uh that goes from the north-east line
that's the purple line
yes
okay
and um how about so you told me that if i took the east line it will take me all the way to the west right
right
okay
so if i already reach west line so you mean there's another uh place there where i can go to north line
uh no
uh can you see the map now on the uh internet
um not yet
can you please show me a map
okay just give me a minute
okay no problem
right okay
i think you should get it very soon in the next few seconds
okay i'm seeing it now
okay can you see number three on your right hand side
number three oh yes
okay
and the ne uh
you move to the left you see expo
yes
alright
so you have to change your train from here
okay
right
and uh so you have to change your train at tanah merah
okay
yah from tanah merah you follow the green line all the way down
yes i'm seeing it
okay
and can you see a crossing between the red and the green line
yes that's the city hall
right
that's city hall yah
so that is actually one of the terminal station uh you can change line from here
yes
oh now i understand
so there are some point where i can make a stop if i desire to change lines
okay
now yah
yes
yes
and actually if you go back to tanah merah you go to the left you will see paya lebar
yes
okay
that is also another line that you can change it's to the yellow line or if you move up a little bit to the purple line
can you see the crisscross between yellow and green
yes that's the paya lebar
yah and then you yes
and then you move up you will be able to see serangoon across between yellow and purple
yes
yes
yes
so this are like once you see an intersection uh with these two round circle these are uh stations that you can change line
oh thank you for that information
okay
and if you are moving from changi that's to the you're in the east
so let's say you're going to take somewhere to bugis if you move to the left
yes
alright
uh then you just go to the direction to bugis
okay
so if i want to go wildlife on my first day how can i get there
yah
yes
alright
okay now can you look to the red line
can you find the red line towards the north
yes
yes
okay
can you find uh there's a intercross intersection between the red and yellow
marymount
yes
lorong chuan
then you move up yes you move up a little bit to ang mo kio
yes
oh so it's in ang mo kio
uh it's not in ang mo kio from there you have to change a bus to go to the zoo and night safari
and how much will that cost me
the ticket for entrance in night safari
okay let me okay you are just going to the night safari park right
yes
okay let me just show you alright can you see now
not yet
it i think it's still loading in my end
there
alright you got it
yes
just a minute it's still loading
okay
it's up now
it's up now uh okay
alright
the night safari park opens from seven thirty to twelve midnight
okay
and the admission cost is thirty two dollars for an adult
that's looks interesting
yes
so basically you will be doing a tram ride
and on the tram ride you will be able to see more than seventy per cent of the what the night safari has to offer and there are a few walking tours that you can do on the night safari park
but most of the time we will be riding
uh you'll be riding as in in the park you mean
yes in the park
yes on the tram because uh the western loop of the night safari you can't walk so you will have to i would suggest that you take uh a tram ride midway
can you see the leopard now
just now
not yet i'm still on the elephant
okay
there is a stop at the uh leopard uh trail
so you could get off the leopard trail do a half an hour walk and then come back to the same tram station to board back the next tram ride and that will bring you back to the entrance
so this ride itself excluding the walk is about forty minutes
okay
forty minutes at um all in all
just on the tram yah
it's a slow ride and you can see the animals very up-close
for example
really
yes quite close
are we allowed to touch the animals
uh no because they are wild animals
they are not like uh trained so it's just that they live in this protected park
so please do not stretch out your hands or any part of your body
thanks for the
and aside from the night safari what are other places that we can visit
because i think we will wait we will need to wait until seven thirty before we will be able to make a tour there right
so what are the other place that i can uh travel maybe on the afternoon on my first day
yes
okay in the alright
in the afternoon you could either do uh the zoo uh as well because they are all they are just located uh next door to one another and you are looking at different animals
ah so you mean the zoo is different from the night safari
yes they are just next door to one another so it's totally different
so you are seeing in the zoo you'll be seeing more mammals uh like the orang-utan the chimpanzee
uh for the night safari it will be more of the nocturnal creatures like the uh uh tigers the leopards uh basically animals that hunt in the night time
okay
okay
yah
so this is something that you may want to consider
uh otherwise on the first day uh you could also do a little bit of uh sightseeing around singapore uh going to the ethnic areas of singapore
yes i think that will be great
so you could do a little bit of the uh chinatown area alright
uh you could also do a little bit of the kampong glam and little india in the morning the whole day alright
then in the night you can take uh all these uh places that i've mentioned
are accessible on the mrt except that you may have to just to change trains but like i mentioned it's fairly easy to get around
yes
but do you also have bars or night uh clubs in singapore
yah we do have quite a lot of the uh bars
uh so maybe the first day you could do that and uh if let's say after your uh night safari and you're not too tired you can bring your husband yourself relax uh i would like to recommend you the clarke quay area or boat quay area that's in the southern part of singapore
and what we'll be able to see there
okay
basically there are a lot of bars there so you could have a drink
uh and of course i'd like to recommend you um specially concocted in singapore it's called the singapore gin sling
uh that is something uh one of our signature drink that you can get in any of the bars
uh but of course if you like something very traditional
then it will be at the raffles hotel the long bar over at the raffles hotel
but what's the
that's also on the southern part of singapore
okay
what's the best drink that you have tried yourself
best drink
uh i would say other drinks other than liquor some traditional drinks uh bubble tea where we can get from small bubble tea shops
uh the indian drink will be lassi uh the malay drinks would teh tarik
um how does bubble drink taste
is it sweet or sour
okay norm
normally it's a tinge of sweetness
so it's tea uh mixed with a lot of different kind of uh fruits but it is not um it doesn't it's not as thick as a smoothie
okay
uh yah
so these are the other drinks that we have uh other than cocktail drinks or wine
hm i think it
i think the uh the bubble tea is healthy because it's tea and fruits
yes
so you can get this bubble tea from a lot of counters uh and they are usually counters located in shopping uh complex
uh you would be able to find one such store otherwise in some of our food centres you maybe a to
me you may be able to find them as well
uh because you know here in our place we have lots of convenient stores that you can see almost around if you're going to make a uh stroll on the night or even day time
it's very easy to buy something um everywhere
do you also have lots of convenient stores in singapore
i guess we do have a lot of convenient stores
um the local chain would be like cheers c h e e r s. it's a small convenient store
okay otherwise uh every other uh let's say front of some shopping centres you will also find little cafés
uh are you talking about like to get snacks and drink
yes
yes
okay
alright
so yes one of the local ones would be like cheers um and then we have like supermarket there is always one in uh the major shopping centres there is always a supermarket
so we have uh the local chain would be ntuc uh cold storage shop n save
uh these are the kind of uh i would say supermarket and you can always find one uh of this supermarket in uh the shopping centres
so you can always get your drinks your snacks basically do even marketing
and how about shopping malls
alright lots of them
uh major shopping centres located at the orchard belt area
uh so orchard road it's one straight road
so again if you remember correctly if you take the green line to the left and then to city hall there's a big shopping centre there called raffles city
beneath the road there is citylink
and if you take another few stops away uh that's to orchard road mrt train station
uh on that same stretch of road there are lots and lots of shopping centre
is the orchard road the main city
well i would say that singapore is one city but it is a place where a lot of the locals the tourists go there for people watching uh do a bit of shopping as well as have tea dinners lunch
it's a place where you can do a lot of things out there
ah okay
because i remember i have one friend who had um on-the-job training um in singapore um because um when she's graduating here um her school send her to singapore and i remember the word orchard
because that's the one where that she always mentioned to me when she came back and she's telling me stories about the places that she has been
um i've been hearing the word orchard that's why i'm asking
right
ah okay
it's um actually this street name is actually named after the street before we developed into orchard road used to be a plantation orchard plantation that's how this street gets its name
uh so like some of the major shopping centre would be um tangs studio tangs uh ngee ann city which is a huge shopping complex
ion it's uh one of the latest addition uh nice shopping centre
uh just all across one another and next to one another
okay then if you go further down the street you have paragon uh plaza singapura um the centrepoint okay uh one three one and we also have uh h&m now in singapore
do you have like a map of that place so that i can i have um a look of the malls shopping different shopping malls that are interconnected there
right
okay
let me yes okay
alright
okay uh i'm actually giving you the map now
thank you
okay can you see uh this shopping centre on top is called ion
yes
okay this is yah
then you can see some of the street scene okay
and i will also give you the map now
yes i'm seeing okay
okay i'm giving you the map now
alright
yah
so okay this is one whole okay can you see this yellow box thing somewhere around number ten
number fifteen number twenty two
yes correct
number fifteen number ten the square yellow thing
yes
what's that
alright
okay this is like the beginning of orchard belt
okay this whole street
so you see all the blue buildings they are all uh hotels or shopping complexes
okay
so you mean from this yellow square until uh the number forty two blue square
yah
all the way that's all orchard road
shopping
yes correct
so these are all shopping
so all the blue buildings are either shops or i mean shopping mall or hotels
hm until forty nine
right
oh that's great
forty yah okay
so you could actually spend the whole day there if you want to
yes
i guess so
yah so uh the shopping hours in singapore uh starts at ten o'clock finish at
ten a.m
ten a.m. and finish at nine thirty
and do you have all the popular brands that i can shop like um do you have what are the popular um brands that i can um see in the shopping malls
because uh
well you have the yah
yah
because i'm not sure if uh the brands here are the same on the um malls in singapore so what are some of the popular brands of clothes and um other stuffs that i can buy
alright
uh we have of course the luxury brands uh gucci coach prada
they are located in most of these shopping centres like number thirty twenty two ion we have them
and then you move on to twenty seven that is paragon right
so these are the major brands can be found here
and of course twenty three as well
okay
okay and number twenty six okay
so these are the luxury brands that you can find uh usually on the first level
uh on the basement area and upper floors uh you can get the mid-range and some of our local brands
uh i think right now the local bags and shoe brand we have a home grown brand called uh charles and keith
okay
they are found in uh number twenty two that's ion
uh number twenty six okay
uh and also twenty three alright
so these are and of course over in number forty seven alright that's plaza singapura
they are found in these shopping mall so this is um home uh home grown so i don't think you have this brand in uh philippines
how about um places where i can buy shoes and bags
yah
the brand that i just mentioned you can buy them
uh otherwise if you don't like this brand uh or you don't like you can't find any of the uh correct patterns that you want in all these shopping centres you'll be able to find other uh stores uh selling shoes bags
so all these shopping centres will have uh things like shoes bag uh sunglasses uh jewellery okay they can be found in all these shopping complexes
wow that's very nice to hear
um well aside from shopping i'm also interested to visit some of the government um offices in singapore
are we allowed i mean are tourist allowed to visit like government offices or different um places where i can see some of the um government sites in your place
yah
uh what particular uh which uh particular government offices you would like to visit
like for example um if i want to see how the city hall looks like in singapore compared to our uh city hall here in philippines like post offices all that stuffs
are we allowed or
alright
okay
the post offices uh yes because it's a public area so you can just walk in to any of our post offices in singapore
uh the city hall right now is uh not used as a city hall anymore we are uh refurbishing it
so we're renovating it and it's going to become one of our art gallery
uh what i will suggest is if you want to pay a visit to our ura that's near to the chinatown area it's called urban renewal authority
uh they we do have a very good city gallery a gallery that you can see um the whole map of singapore as well as uh the central part of singapore
okay
how about um like a national museum do you have one
yes we have a very good uh national museum at the bras basah area
so uh that will showcase singapore from the beginning right up to uh the present day
okay
so how the how singapore evolved from years um from different eras right
yes
so uh it showcase you uh even before raffles arrival uh right through uh to second world wa uh and then raffles arrived where do people live you know we have kings before
and we move on to the second world war period from nineteen forty three to nineteen forty five and to present day alright
uh to col uh to independence to merger we sing uh sorry before our independence nineteen sixty three to nineteen sixty five we merged with uh malaya to form the federation of malaysia
and independence how we struggle through uh to in order to find to build homes for the people living here jobs to modern day
um s
so you mean
so i will really be able to learn a lot about singapore in that place
yes correct
so uh you'll be able to uh learn a lot about singapore in fact uh the whole history of singapore
i think i will put that um on my list of places to visit
yes
so yah
so when you are going to chinatown so you can pay a visit there okay then you learn ab uh sorry
uh the history of singapore you will learn from the national history of singapore
uh national uh museum of singapore at the uh bras basah area
and after that you can do the ura gallery uh and the chinatown area together
is it on same area
uh the ura urban redevelopment authority it's the same area as chinatown
uh okay
the national museum will be closer to the supreme court
because you mentioned that you wanted to do some singapore uh uh offices right
sup
yah
uh we wouldn't you can also sit-in one of the court sessions in the supreme court if you are just uh yourself and your husband
so any of the courts that's open for hearing you can actually walk in um even for a ten minutes if you just want to sit-in and you can just give
really
yes
uh so uh you've mentioned that uh we are allowed to enter one of the courts
yes
uh but uh before you enter into the supreme court you will have to go through security
so just like how you will pass through uh the immigration while coming in uh or leaving singapore the normal security uh procedure that means you have check we will have to check your bags um and you make sure that you do not carry any uh sharp objects and uh there's no strictly no photography inside the supreme court
really
because it really delights me to know it because actually personally i want to have a tour in one of the supreme courts uh in singapore because i used to do transcriptions in court proceedings
and
okay that's great
yes uh that's why it delighted me when you mentioned that i can also have a tour in the supreme court because um honestly i'm very i'm curious on how the persons that i used to transcribe um i mean i really want to see them in person right
and um but are we allowed to sit-in in like for if there is an on-going trial and are we allowed to sit-in on the proceeding
yes you are allowed to
like i mentioned you just have to go through security before you enter into the court uh before you enter into the supreme court the normal uh procedure meaning like no sharp objects and strictly no photography when you are inside the supreme court
okay
but only for a limited time
uh office hours i would say
uh okay
yah
aside from supreme courts um what are uh the other government places that we can visit
okay
uh the supreme court ch sit-in one of the court proceedings
uh like i said if you don't want to sit you can sit-in for as long or as short as you want to
okay
and the ura would be uh a good introduction to our city landscape
okay
yes
like i said you can do it with together with chinatown
supreme court you can do it together with the national library uh sorry uh national museum of singapore
okay
and the
so you also have national libraries
oh yes
the library is also located near the uh bras basah area
so national library national uh museum supreme court
so that will be also around the national museum area
yes
pretty nearby
ah okay
yah
so
so i can also drop by
the library is a green building
that means they have a lot of uh green itianative uh initiative that is uh built into the whole library
but we have a lot of other uh community libraries all found within the various estate in singapore
okay
so enough for the government places
how about place for relaxation
what are the places that uh i can have some memorable experiences there
okay
right
uh we have uh sungei buloh which is on the northwest of singapore
so you saw the supreme court right on the screen
yes
yah that's the picture of the supreme court
so you can do another wildlife walk over at sungei buloh
is that still on the east
uh that is northwest
northwest
yah
what can i see on that um area
okay
there are mangrove and uh wetland wildlife so a lot of birds
can you saw a picture now of the sungei wetland
yes
okay
national park
yah
okay
alright
so this is um what we have out at the uh northwest of singapore
and we do have a free wireless uh trail
okay you can just uh sort of uh borrow the uh uh uh webcam
okay
okay
and another uh other walks that you can do you climb uh bukit timah hill as well
do you have mountains
well uh bukit timah is not a mountain it's a hill
we don't have mountains in singapore unfortunately
our tallest hill is bukit timah but it has a lot of uh flora and fauna
and but how high is the hill
uh it's three hundred and eighty six uh metres tall
like um how many how many floors of a building
how many floor
approximately about uh sixty i would say i think in a region of about sixty to seventy storey
approximately
really
that's a bit um high sixty to seventy
a bit high
oh but you are not going to climb steps it's like uh a slope going up the hill and uh well you can do it within you can climb from the bottom to the top of hill
it is not uh a too fast running up just walking a brisk walk you should be able to arrive in one hour
but um are there also transport available
uh no you have to climb up
ah okay
yah
but you see a lot of interesting plants uh when you are up on the uh along the way up to the hill
okay
how about um hotels
what are the number one hotel that you can offer me
okay just uh i think you should be able to see a portion of the road climbing up to bukit timah
okay you've seen that
yes
the visitor centre
okay i'll come back to the hotel
okay now let
nature reserve
yes
alright let's go to the hotels in singapore uh there are lots of different category of hotels so again it depends on uh what you're looking at
uh there are budget hotels
if you like to stay in orchard road uh since this is a birthday celebration uh
yes
yah you can consider staying around orchard road
so you mean there are several hotels in along orchard road
there are lots of yah there are lot of hotels on orchard road so it all depends on your uh price uh category
uh starting from uh just beginning of orchard road uh at the junction of scotts road we have like hyatt hotel marriott hotel
okay
and you move on we have grand park hotel
so again i'm coming back to the stretch of orchard road uh
yes
we have like uh uh york hotel just beside the goodwood park hotel elizabeth hotel
okay so uh these are all the various hotel that is located on uh uh orchard road
and then if
but
yah
okay
um do the hotels offer like one day stay so because i'm thinking if it's possible for us to stay on different hotels every day so that we could have different experiences
yah uh will that be fine
yes that's fine
uh they do have uh you can have a one night stay uh in the various hotel so normal check-in like two to three o'clock in the afternoon uh and the next day the check out time uh is around twelve o'clock uh the next day
yes
okay
because um i want to have um one a bit expensive stay like on the second day if i'm going to get a 3 day visit
i'm planning to make the second day a very special one so if ever i'm going to get um a hotel that will have like a jacuzzi and all those special um things that we can enjoy
so and like for the uh third day on or the first and the third day we can get like a hotel that we can basically make a stay before going to the adventures that we want to do like in the wildlife because basically we will not be able to stay the whole day right on the hotel
so i'm planning if we can get a uh a hotel that we can stay just for one day
alright
okay there are quite a number of hotels uh what you mentioned
uh there is like uh fullerton bay hotel it's like a five-star luxury hotel
uh the the and this building just now you mentioned about post office right
it used to be uh the first uh central post office in singapore but it's now converted to uh fullerton hotel
so that's one it's a five-star luxury
uh we have at city hall mrt fairmont hotel
on sentosa itself since i think you may also visit sentosa you could stay at the capella
but these are like i mentioned these are uh five-star luxury hotels
okay
five-star
yah
okay or you could also stay at the marina bay sands
uh this is like uh landmark building
uh it faces the marina bay so you get a good uh view and of course remember to ask for the bay view side of the hotel okay
uh and around the bay you have other hotels like um the pan pacific the mandarin oriental these are all uh nice hotel
okay so lots and lots of hotels available if you just want something very special
okay
so it just depends on the on the place where we will stay right
yes and also uh the budget uh that you would like to spend because uh they range uh from in the region of about singapore dollars one night stay about four hundred plus
yes the budget
on five-star hotels
yes they are five-star hotel
but on the um normal hotels how much basically is the price
okay
if you are talking about uh let's say uh a hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars
yes
okay we have some of these hotel
there is one in the orchard belt it's called the hotel supreme it's near to the plaza singapura
i'm also seeing east village
okay
east village
yes
okay that's a bit far off
on east coast
yah it's a little bit far off
uh okay maybe i can also recommend you this hotel called uh link hotel
it's in
ling
link l i n k
oh link
link hotel
uh it is located in the residential area called tiong bahru and you are about uh just one mrt away from chinatown
okay
alright
or uh that's a three-star hotel we move down it's oxford hotel
it's also a good location uh but they don't have facilities like the spa
okay but you can stay there as well for one night then you do your museums your ethnic area and then the next day you move to a nice hotel
yes
correct
yah
so that would be in the region of below two hundred dollars per night
and yes
so that will cost me like four hundred for if i'm going to stay on my first and third day
uh yah that's right
right
and how about sentosa
okay
sentosa of course the best uh there's a
how what are the what are the things that i can see there
what you okay
sentosa there are lots of things there is the beach alright
so you can do your morning uh swim in the beach the lagoon
then you can go to the universal theme park
you can go by uh cable car to sentosa form uh either mount faber or harbourfront
can you see the map now of sentosa
um it's still loading
okay
okay
oh it's like a theme park
okay so you c it's an island
uh okay sentosa can you see a uh a bridge
yes
a broad wall
okay can you see that
okay
so it's linked to the mainland it's an island off the southern part of singapore
so it is one big playground
it's one big playground alright
now
so we need
is it where we can do karting
uh sorry what did you say
karting
oh karting yes
yes
yah
uh we have what we call the luge
what's that
it's a little bit similar uh you can ride on this vehicle
is it a motor vehicle
yes something like that
uh but there is uh fixed routing that you have to do
is it a two wheel motor or
right
yes so you
so it's like a bicycle
uh i wouldn't say it's like a bicycle you don't ride you know
you basically press on like uh accelerator
a little bit like uh those bumper cars but it's not built like a bumper car it is more open
okay
let me see
okay i will show you what the luge is like
okay
can you show me one
yah um
it's still loading
yah
do you mean i just need to have uh i just need to pay on the entrance or i need to pay on every rides that i want to uh try
uh no this one you will have to pay extra uh okay there are different uh admission prices
so let's say if you want to do uh the two uh the luge alright uh that's eighteen dollars
two luge that means two ride
uh now can you see this people doing a luge
yes
yah
so it's a little bit like bumper car but it's not so covered right
that's the skyride
yes
it looks very uh enjoyable
yah
so it's quite great fun uh doing the luge
the prices for just one luge and one skyride will be twelve dollars and fifty cents per person
okay
yah
so this is the extra uh prices that you will have to pay
and then you can go over and do the uh resort world like uh the universal studio
okay

lynnette here
hi goo hell hello
good afternoon too
i'm uh participant number six
i'm catherine
how are you
okay i'm fine catherine
uh so i hope you're feeling great as well
yah i am
so
okay so how may i help you
um i'm planning to um go to singapore this coming may
and i really don't honestly i really don't have any idea of what i'm going to do aside from shopping
so uh maybe you could help me um with the um my destinations and where i could um see other places like um uh zoos or malls
cause that are
okay
alright
yes
like uh yah
so um my i'm planning to visit singapore probably in may
right
so that's going to be a three day and two nights to so that's going to be on may three and then i'll have to leave on may five
alright
okay and you are coming with uh how many people are you coming with
um i'm going with my sister and my nephew
so it's going to be the three of us
right
and your nephew is below twelve
yes correct
okay
so um well first of all we would have over here in singapore we speak a lot of us speak english
our street signs are all in english
so you don't really have a problem with communications
oh very good
um hm that's
now when you arrive in the changi airport do get some singapore money first
exchange some money first with our money changer booth
they are found both in the transit area as well as just immediately after the uh after you collect your bags and you exit from the airport
there are money changers there
okay
just get some smalls notes like a dollar coin two dollars notes and five dollars to enable you to travel on our mrt
okay so first thing i wanna know um how is the weather going to be in may
is it fine like it won't gonna rain right
yah
is it summer
yes it's not really the raining season
oh that's great
uh in s yah in singapore we have summer the whole year round
oh really
that's really nice
yes nice warm weather
and uh well even if it rains is not a big issue because you could always spend some time in the mall have a cup of coffee
by the time you finish your drinks the rain would have stopped
just okay
sounds really great
yah
just the way i love it
right
okay
so once you board the mrt you just uh look for the uh machine the ticket machine and they would tell you how much money to put in
uh just take note there is a deposit of one dollar
so when you exit from your destination remember to take back your uh one dollar deposit
um is there any um a card-like um deposit that you'll have to use for the mrt or
uh sorry i didn't get you
um do we get us a card like um pass
is that
oh yes
once you go to the ticket machine uh you press your destination which particular station you want to go to and the machine will tell you how much to pay to that destination
uh you will receive a card that looks like a credit card that size
okay once you get the card you proceed to the um entrance to the station just tap your card you go inside uh and airport that line is the green line is the east-west line
okay
hm alright
okay
so you will have to change train at the station the second station called tanah merah
tanah merah
how do you spell tanah merah
yes
t a n a h
hm okay
tanah merah
so i'll take a note of it
yah
yes
and then so um if i'm going to um because uh i think um i will like to stick on a budget. um
where can i stay
okay there are quite of few options
again it depends on uh which particular area that you like to stay in
uh there are some uh hotels which are fairly inexpensive uh along orchard road
which is on our main shopping area
there are uh hotels that are located in another area
if you look at the green line uh that's it's somewhere if you look at number five which is on the south
orchard ro
correct
right
uh you move up a little bit between four and five uh there is this area called tiong bahru
hm tiong bahru
okay
yah
so there's a hotel there as well called link hotel
otherwise if you again follow the green line you will come to uh bugis there's also hotel there
and if you move up a little bit that's lavender
okay that's uh v hotel
okay you go down a little bit to the yellow line bras basah uh there is also a hotel out there
and you move up the red line to orchard road orchard can you see orchard
yup
okay
uh there is two other hotels there york hotel elizabeth hotel
uh they are i would say um reasonable rates and yet you are very uh right in the heart of the city
when you say reasonable rates um uh could you give me like an assumption amount
okay uh per night uh in the range of uh a hundred and sixty dollars right up to two hundred dollars per room
alright
the um per room
so um i could rent a room with um together with my sister and my nephew
yah
yes you could
uh we can stay in one room okay
yes and you probably would require an extra bed for your nephew
great
huh
uh so this is the hotel area that you are talking about
of course you like to uh spend a little bit more then again there are other hotels that you may want to consider along orchard road
of course like international hotels we have hyatt hotel
uh down to grand park hotel
it's near to the somerset mrt
in between somerset and uh orchard road
so basically um along this um uh so i could see a map
um this is like an mrt map right
uh so i will just have to follow um i will just have to rode um mrt to get to another hotel and then to another hotel
is that correct
yes
uh yes
unless you planning to change hotel every night
otherwise yah
so you take the mrt for sightseeing uh i'm showing this uh mrt map for you get a feel of the different uh lines that we have
and just to show you the hotel location for the various uh hotels that i'm recommending
yah so there are very conveniently located because they are very near to the mrt and it's the mrt is actually a very inexpensive way of travelling in singapore
okay
correct
so that's what i want to hear con the conveniency with the travel yah
okay so um if i wanted to like shop for um if i'm going to stay for example in um orchard and then i would like to shop
um where would you um suggest for me to go`
um where would you um suggest for me to go`
yes
right
right
right
right
okay we have a over in near the somerset mrt there are a few shopping centre
actually the whole stretch from orchard station right to dhoby ghaut every other hotel or building it's either a hotel or a shopping mall
right
so our shopping hours starts from ten a.m. to nine thirty every day
hum
okay
so
yah
so you can do lots of shopping options out there
yah so i can stretch i need to stretch my legs before i get to singapore
so you sho yah you have to do a little bit of uh exercise before you come and do your shopping out here
okay
okay
so this is the shopping area
so there's always a lot of uh things to do out here
if you are tired just go in to any of the cafés um have a smoothie or cold drink coffee tea alright
and carry on shopping
yah
okay
alright
so i guess for your nephew you may want to do some sightseeing uh with him as well okay
or your friend uh yah
you could do a little bit of uh sightseeing
so let say you are staying somewhere on orchard road alright
the hotel that i was talking about
uh in the range of two hundred dollars you could take the subway and you alight at city hall
correct
okay
ci where is that
ah okay
okay
you look down the red line city hall
yap
correct
okay
oh you go to this and you just walk about five minutes
hm from the city hall
yap
alright
and then
okay and it's a nice area
you just walk along the bay uh the bay area
the esplanade and you will see this uh lion which is an icon of singapore
ah the merlion right
yes
okay can you see now
hm not yet
um but it um i've seen it on the um internet yah
uh so from city hall i will just have to um walk um five minutes
is that five minutes along five minutes from the city hall
okay five minutes to the padang area it's a shady spot
you can walk and then you will come to the merlion
okay
so i would say about ten minutes
ah okay
yah
so you can take nice picture out there because the merlion is a symbol of singapore
it's very famous
yah
and from there you can go opposite is a uh nice building
you can take a picture of this uh building out there and that is the fullerton hotel
fullerton hotel
yah
okay
so you can continue on your journey because the merlion is located in the financial district of singapore
uh you will just use the underpass to go across to the opposite side of the merlion and you will board your train at the raffles place mrt
underpa
and from there you take the west line
um can you show me a map perhaps
so i could just visualise
the area
okay just give a minute
okay
so um. along the um is where is that merli um around uh the merlion icon um uh are there any place that where we could buy some giveaways which we could take home for our friends
uh okay you don't really have to buy it from the merlion area but there is a shop a small shop at the merlion area
okay now i'm showing you the map of uh what i'm talking about
the merlion can you see on the top-right hand corner
correct
yah
top-right uh yah
that is the merlion
okay
uh so you walk underneath the uh underpass
can you see the underpass
yap
okay that is the raffles place mrt
okay
uh just at this corner here there is actually a shop there
so if you want to pick up some uh souvenirs like the merlion keychain and all that
you know you pick it up there then you board the mrt
yah souvenirs
okay
and you will go down to the cha uh tanjong pagar
tanjong pagar
yah
you alight at tanjong pagar because i'm going to introduce you to the chinatown area
alright
then yah so i do understand you have uh chinatown in philippines right
yes correct
hm but it is a little bit different from what we have here
uh and you may want to visit the oldest chinese temple in singapore
yes
ok
they call the thian hock keng temple
thian so when i go to the temple do i need to bring anything
well just be appropriately dressed like uh no short shorts
uh and try to put on like shirt or t-shirts with sleeves
okay
hm alright
yah
so basically that's all uh that
so they are particular basically with def how we dress
yes
so i'm gonna show you the image of uh thian hock keng temple there
so right
it says that uh right now we are doing some restoration work to the temple but it's one of our oldest chinese is our oldest chinese temple
so um with this um temple we cannot go in since going to be restorated is that correct
and then we can take pictures outside or
yes you ar yes you are allowed to take pictures outside the chinese temple
in fact the most beautiful part of the temple would be the roof where you see a lot of dragons right
the dragons out there
the roof it looks like bamboo because according to the chinese the bamboos are a symbol of long life
correct
but they are not made by bamboo they are made of tiles
is uh yah
it's built like it looks like a bamboo that's all
yes
looks like
so uh you could still do uh you could still go inside although the temple is undergoing restoration
uh just a feel uh and a god uh in this particular temple is dedicated to the goddess of the sea call ma zhu po
so you could have a look inside this chinese temple
and when you leave the temple this picture shows you the main entrance of the temple you turn to your right-hand side okay you walk about uh four hundred metres and you will come to a hawker centre
okay
can
which centre i'm sorry
hawker
hawker
uh yes
h a w k e r it is a non-air-conditioned food centre
and what do i do there
i really don't
okay
you can have a lunch
ah okay
yah you can have your lunch there
because the price it's very reasonable
are these
okay so
um so uh do they have like a specialty in that um restaurant
uh it's not a restaurant
it's all little shop which is about uh a hundred metre kind of a shop hundred square metre
uh and they sell a lot of different kind of food
uh so it's variety of food yah
huh
yes it's a variety uh ranging from chinese food to uh malay and you can eat to indian and you can even get some western meals there as well
alright
so uh some of the local dishes you may want to try it out would be um carrot cake
alright
hm is tha
okay
is
so
yah
it's not the
definitely
it's not what you think the carrot looks like
i would like to try that
uh this is our version of carrot cake
uh it's actually white radish
it's radish fried with uh flour and egg
and sometimes it looks a bit dark because they have been cook with a uh dark sauce
dark soya sauce
okay now can you see the word the highlighted area
amoy street food centre
that's
uh yah
so you see the red um thian hock keng temple if you look at ayer telok ayer street
hm oh there
yap
right
you are here remember i said when you leave the temple you turn right
so it's about a four hundred metres walk
okay and you actually pass by the al-abrar mosque
and then uh
the highlighted area again that's um a mosque
uh it's a place of worship for the muslim
yap
muslims
yah
but uh uh normally if you are non-muslims we don't encourage you to go in
you stand outside you could actually look inside
hm okay
so and then you just turn to the left again you come to the amoy street food centre
yah so just look around the food centre
see what looks interesting
they are always uh photos of the food that each of this vendor uh sell
yah and again do carry a bit of singapore money with you
cause they are like a few dollars each
like uh carrot cake would probably cost about uh two fifty two dollars fifty cents to three dollars for one plate
oh okay
i will definitely
uh as
definitely i would try that carrot cake
yah
so it's actually yes it's quite different from the uh kind of a baked carrot cake that we often yah
so this is the chinese version
yah
right
yes yap
and uh of course there are lots of other delicious food
so if you are not so uh if you just want something a little bit light then you could try our fish soup with noodles
okay
so that would cost you a meal there would cost you three dollars for a main dish and a drink will be in the region of a cold drink in a region of a dollar forty cents
okay.
okay
yah
so that's taken care of
and then you just walk
can you see amoy street
yap
correct yup
okay there is a pathway uh a kind of steps where you climb up
it's about two-story tall
and then you arrive at ann siang hill
ann siang hill
ann siang hill in green can you see that
corre yup i can
alright
so uh these are very nice houses out here
um interesting i would say because some of the houses here has two doors
the outer door which is smaller like a cowboy door
okay
yah and then they have a bigger door
so these are own traditionally by the peranakan chinese
that means the strait born chinese
hm alright
yah so bit it's a nice row of houses here
okay
and you walk down
and uh
ann siang road again
okay
and you come to south bridge road
okay
right
okay
and you walk against the traffic
okay
and you cross
from here you can see sri mariamman temple
yah so this is an indian temple
so we are doing your tour in the morning
uh the sri mariamman temple will be open til twelve o'clock in the afternoon
in the afternoon they still keep the front gates opened
but there will not be so much activities going on in the afternoon
hm so it's much better to um go there in the morning i guess
they wouldn't before twelve o'clock
um hm correct
yes so you can do that
uh take a look and you have to remove your shoes before you go into the indian temple
just put your shoes uh in the shoe racks
yah and do a short walk in the temple
and when you're out you turn left to pagoda street
pagoda street
okay
yah
so again you will see a lot of the chinatown uh houses with this bamboo roof
and you also mention you like to pick up some souvenirs
correct
yah so there are some chinese souvenirs that you may want to pick up
okay
uh right
so you can just walk around
and there are some coffee shops coffee shops meaning uh non-air-conditioned drinking places and food place
right
so anytime you are hungry or thirsty you can always pick up some food or drinks along the
okay uh
along the way
correct
yah
okay
very convenient
yes
so you follow this road again down to trengganu street
okay
okay so
and you make a left turn
okay
you come to sago street
okay
right
now on sago street there are about two shops there that sells uh specifically chinese pastry
chinese pastry
yah that you may not see in the normal uh kind of bakery
so there are all sorts of chinese pastry there
okay
alright
so uh and if you again want to visit another chinese temple there is another chinese temple uh called the buddha relic temple
it's just in-between sago street and sago lane
okay
so um let's say if i wanted to um go to a park or a zoo for my nephew so where can i go
right
uh i would recommend the morning or afternoon zoo for you
okay so that like you can do like a half day uh almost full day already right
because you were walking from the merlion right up to the chinatown
and i guess with all this walk you would be a little bit tired
correct
so in the night time you may just want to uh rest up for uh rest for a little while before you head out for dinner
okay
uh we will come back to the dinner places later on
let's go to the zoo
okay
so um where is this zoo located
okay the zoo is located in the uh north part of singapore
it north part
so uh um how do i get there
do i rode the train or how's the mode of transportation to um going to the zoo from um let say orchard road
okay we do have the zoo express uh that you can take
uh as you can see there are different timings and uh different uh places of uh pick-up
so
otherwise you can take the subway the mrt to ang mo kio
and from there you board a bus to the zoo
oh okay so it's a night safari
ah okay
this is the morning and afternoon zoo
uh if he if your nephew like the different uh the animals you can do combine both together
so i would suggest if you want to do two attractions you can do in the afternoon
uh and dinner out in the zoo or night safari park
there are food and beverages and fast food available in both the um zoo and the night safari park
right
so uh in the day zoo this will be more uh mammals that you see in the day zoo
uh you can also do uh there's also a tram ride that you can take and then uh in the middle of the zoo you can alight and walk around do a little bit of the uh attractions
and then you board back the tram
alright same thing with the night safari
the night safari you were going to see different animals
the night safari will be uh ninety per cent uh it's yah
ninety per cent will be nocturnal creatures uh like the leopards the tigers which are nocturnal creatures
um they are encaged
no our zoo both our zoo and night safari so they are called open zoo
so you won't see cages
uh they are thro they are put in uh as close as possible to what they would live in the wild
yah but not to worry
they do not come out of their so-called enclosure
okay
hm so it's really
now i can breathe
yah
it's beautiful it's like park you know
is i'm showing you now uh just portion of the day zoo
and let's go to the night safari park
okay
okay this is our night safari park
yes so you can see the first picture
these are wild malayan tapir
so you'll be getting on this tram
uh it's a open tram alright
uh and these animals are wild creatures so do not stretch out any part of your body
alright and do not touch the animals they are wild animals
the leopards uh they are separated from you by the glass enclosure
hm alright
are we allowed to feed them
uh no feeding because they are wild animals
and the zoo and the night safari have a standard uh feeding time for the animals
so we don't want them to get overweight right
okay
alright
correct
okay
so this is uh it will be very interesting
you get on the tram ride and in the middle uh there is a stop called the leopard's trail you get off the tram do a half an hour walk to see the animals
come back and take the next tram and you are back at the entrance
so on the tram ride it's about forty minutes excluding the walk
uh and at the e main entrance there is another walking trail called the fishing cat trail
correct
hm okay
so this is the uh night safari
okay
there are like shows if your nephew is interested we have the creatures of the night show
he would definitely like that
this yah
so what the safari do is they bring up some of the animals the smaller animals and uh it's just a it's a simple show uh to show you how basically animals behave
that's about it
alright we don't dress them up because they are still wild animals
and the show time is seven thirty eight thirty and nine thirty p.m. uh if the weather permits
okay
alright
so this is the shows that you can do uh i would recommend a minimum of two hours in the night safari park
of course if you can spend three hours that would be better
okay so
yah
so if you don't want to walk then forty minutes on the uh tram ride
but i definitely recommend you to do at least one walking trail at the leopards trail
yah
hm alright
so i will show you the walking trails because on the tram ride you see seventy per cent of the animals
the balance of thirty per cent you will have to walk
ver
so we divide the park into the various sector like himalayan foothills the nepalese river valley
okay
equitoria
so there is
yah
there is like um a theme
yah for each of the sector
so you will have uh areas that stimulate the natural habitat of these different animals that are found in these areas
okay
yah so this is the night safari park
yah
right
definitely
yah sounds interesting
yah it's a very popular tourist spot for both the locals and the tourists
right
great
yah
excellent
so and i guess your nephew may also be interested to do the jurong bird park as well
yah okay
let me see
if he's into birds
yah he is
his
okay
he talks like a bird
right
alright
non-stop
so yah we have like again different walks
and i think you should not miss the lorry loft
okay
see now these lorries are free flying
yah
and you can feed them
okay
okay but you cannot feed them with human food
hm okay
so we feed them with the honey water and that's available in the lorry loft itself
huh
so and the birds the lorries will come and perch on your hand to feed
because when you're holding this bowl of honey water all the birds will come
so it makes a very good pictures alright for your family
okay
great
yah and there are so colourful
yah
yah
so these are the ones
and of course also do not miss the show
definitely i would like to um watch the show
yes
and then um so for um how much does it cost to like uh take the night safari and do the show
uh night safari or show
um both
um everything
uh both the night safari and the jurong bird park
yup
cause i want to spend the whole day in that area with the jurong bird park and then on the night safari and then
the zoo
the zoo yah
okay
okay
so for adult
okay
for the adult it's fifty eight dollars
uh the child is thirty eight dollars for the three parks
ah okay
jurong bird park
so what you can do is you do the jurong bird park in the morning there's a zoo in the afternoon and the night safari in the night time
correct
yah
that's what i want
yah and that's like a full day programme already
um hm yes
so the night before get a good rest
right
cause you're doing three parks in one day
yes
i'm going to um travel all over
i'm gonna visit singapore the whole singapore if for three days
okay
alright
and the following day you can get a bird's eye view of singapore by going to take a ride on the singapore flyer
singapore what
singapore flyer
a ferris wheel
flyer huh
oh no i'm afraid of ferris wheel
i'm afraid of heights
but my sister could um my sister and nephew could
they're braves
but not me
oh you don't like that
oh okay
okay
so you stay on the ground and take pictures for them
it's a enclosed uh ferris wheel
it's like a uh cable car that goes in a circle
yes
yes
um if it's enclosed i think i might consider
yah there
you see uh the enclose right
the enclose area
ah okay yes
because the ferris wheel here uh are open so i'm afraid of them
so if it's enclosed i think um i would have the courage to take the ride
alright
right
okay
so you can do that and again if you want to do some local food the ground floor area there is another uh food centre on the ground floor area
so um is that uh what's that
uh is that a bay beside the ferris wheel
yes
uh that is the marina bay
okay
the marina bay
so it's just very close by
you can go to again okay that's another view of the uh singapore flyer it's like a cabin
okay and then you saw the bay right
the bay
okay
so you walk on this uh bridge a very interesting bridge that looks like our uh dna bridge
okay
to go to the marina bay sands
and then um okay
at the marina bay um um are they allowed to um swimming
do swimming
no
uh okay uh yah unless you are guest
uh and you are staying at the mari of course yes
uh otherwise if you want to again have a bird's eye view uh from singapore to the south china sea to the city centre uh you can buy a ticket to go up to the skypark
okay
skypark yah
yah right on top of the uh three hotels
can you see now the skypark
hm yup the deck view
yah
okay
yes so you have different uh
areas
different view alright
so you see the sea view so that is towards uh the south china sea
okay
okay uh from a three number three right up to number seven you will see the city singapore city view
ah alright
alright so it could you see a very good view uh of the skyline
if you wanted to see both so you'll have to be number eight i guess
yes correct
but you can walk around alright
uh you can around this uh cantilever
ah okay
okay the cost of a ticket
it's twenty dollars for an adult and fourteen dollars for a child
hm okay
yah
yah
okay yah
and um once you come down okay you walk across the uh underpass
and you can do the restaurants
okay there are lots of restaurants out there
hm they have if you like chinese food then maybe i can recommend you ding tai fung
yah i like chinese food
and there are lots of other kind of a cuisine out here in the uh marina bay sands area
okay
okay
alright
okay and of course but i guess with a kid you may want to go to the casino huh
i leave him with his mother
and then i go to the casino myself
oh okay
okay
uh the casino is just in the basement area so you can have uh some fun out in the casino as well
hm okay
or you can even do uh the museum
okay
is there any place that um let say i'm in the marina bay um marina bay sands um is there any place for where we could left off the children and then um do the casino
yes
okay both of you right
yah
we do have a
um because um um here there are uh places in malls were we could like um uh leave the children and then we go to shopping
and then the children will play on that area and then we'll get them once we're done
right
yes in the marina bay sands yes there is but not in all the other mall
uh only selected ones uh do offer this service
so you could do that yah
and i think he could be interested in this uh arts and science uh museum
in the marina bay sands as well
okay
okay
okay
so this is uh the permanent uh gallery
okay that's what you will see
it's all about arts and science
ah okay
okay
okay so you could do that and that would be almost uh more than half a day already
correct
and but of course again you can do a spot of uh shopping out there as well
okay so um a while ago i'll
i saw a flea market
um i don't know which um i saw flea market here on the website i don't know where would that lead me
so do you have like um flea markets in singapore
yes we do have
uh it's in the clarke quay area it's on sunday
oh okay it's sunday only
yes it's only on sunday
otherwise we do have a flea market uh in sungei road
sungei road
yah
okay
and um i have heard about something like little india
so what do um what are is there any activities that i could get um do in little india
okay let me just show you the flea market in uh
sungei road
sungei road huh
okay
okay these are the flea market
it's operates everyday uh from four p.m. onwards
yah
so uh they really sell all kinds of stuff in this flea market
okay and we want to go to little india right
yup
in little india do all people are indians
are all people indians
indians
yah it's an indian community
not necessary
ah okay
okay
just that uh traditionally this was a uh an indian quarters
alright
traditionally
ah okay
okay now i'm showing you some of the images in little india
okay the first picture is a light up uh in this festival which normally happens in august
it's call uh deepavali
yah
and this is one of the street the second picture will show you uh street in little india
the third one is this food is called rojak
it means like uh mix and match of various kinds of food that you like
and they serve you with this orangey kind of gravy which is a little bit sweet and just a tinge of spice in there
hm and the things are deep fried
okay
alright
the next picture again quite commonly seen in little india these are flower garland shop
uh the white flowers that you see will be jasmine flower
the white ones
yah
and uh these flower garlands are brought by the hindus when they go to the temple the indian temples to offer their prayers
so they offer these flower garlands to their gods
yup
alright
alright
and then we just move downwards
okay
okay
you see a very elaborate structure
yah what's that
okay
this is the main entrance of a hindu temple
alright
alright
okay again more street scenes in little india
okay another food that is served in little india
so some of the local food will be like vadi
vadi looks a little bit like a doughnut
and you can eat it
normally the store owner will give you a green chili as well
so you take a bite on the green chili and a bite of this vadi
so it's something very local
okay so more of like spicy foods
uh if you don't want to eat the chili then you just eat the doughnut
the doughnut
yah uh it's like it's called vadi
oh okay
yah
so that gives you a little bit of an idea of what uh little india has
here again more pictures of what little india has
okay
and you may want to do a temporary tattoo which we call it henna painting
yah i will love to do that
that will cost you about five dollars
okay some uh souvenirs in case you want to buy will be like brassware
boxes the jewellery boxes uh jewellery boxes made of wood
okay hanging things ornaments for the house
okay
and bangles okay
plastic bangles a bunch of them would cost you a few dollars about five dollars
okay and saris
the next picture that i am highlighting will be uh a sari that is five point five metres
and you wrap it around your waist and you wear with a short blouse
yah
alright
so these are traditionally worn by the south indians
okay
okay
so this is what we can do in little india
okay
okay
lots of se pictures out here
so very colourful uh
and then i'm going to highlight this one
yah
yah
it's naan
alright
okay
naan
uh you can either eat this with a curry or you can have side dishes like tandoori and you can see they are served on banana leaf
hm you'll get
now i'm hungry
yah
this is the traditional way of eating indian food and you eat with your hands
hm okay
okay
and of course there are hotels there located in little india as well
lots of picture for you uh to see uh okay and the souvenir that i'm talking about these are jewellery uh boxes that i highlighted to you here
alright
okay
so all this
they are very colourful
teens that we will see in little india
the mrt train station is called little india mrt train station
okay
so you could do again the like three hours you know
and the temporary tattoo will last you for about seven days
yah if
ah okay hm
if you don't wash your hands of course it'll last longer
longer yah
correct
yah
so that is the temporary tattoo made from the henna plant

and if you have beaches or probably just some resorts
oh
yah we have beaches
we have beaches uh on the island
and we also have an island called sentosa that you can go to
uh when you talk about hanging out what do you mean actually
oh we love going to the mall and bar hopping
oh okay
uh that's uh quite normal right
mall uh that means shopping
uh drink coffee in between your shopping
yes
right
alright and bar hopping
alright
alright
uh have you been to singapore before
oh not yet
so that's why we're really excited to go there next month
so i want to make the most of the vacation so that's why i'm calling you so that i hope that you could help me out
uh yes
uh let me show you i think you sound quite independent
thank you
shall i show you the uh mass rapid transit system
sure
singapore
so that when you arrive you can take the train
to go to from the airport into town the fastest way and uh very efficient
right
mrt
alright
yes mrt
that stands for mass rapid transit
here it is
let me show you the map so you can see the whole of singapore also
sure
uh just a moment
take your time
uh where are you intending to stay uh
uh where are you intending to stay uh uh what sort of uh
uh i don't have the slightest idea at the moment
so if you can help me find a really affordable hotel
what do you think
okay uh
so that will be perfect
okay what you have here are you getting it on the screen now
yes i can see it
so do you see the green line at the bottom right-hand side
that is the changi airport
and if you follow the line uh from the right to the left
you are entering into town
alright
and that is where we have maybe the better class hotels
uh it's also the business area
if you follow uh a little bit further out
you know where the green line hits the yellow and the red
the intersection you mean
yes
you follow the green line uh up left towards the north
you'll get orchard
do you see orchard
yes i can see it
orchard is a very popular road
and that is
you can get off there
there are lots of uh shops there
night clubs
if you go the other way when you take the train and you go down to you switch to clarke quay you could actually walk
uh that's near one of our rivers called the singapore river
and you might want to bar hop there at night
well oh that's perfect
but how far eh
can you suggest a hotel
uh an affordable hotel
affordable as in uh what sort of price range are you talking about
because i'll be having a thousand singaporean dollars with me
oh that will go a long way
just
really
yes
wow so i hope you can help me find a
because uh you are
uh good place
you are not looking for luxurious hotels
no not really because we'll just stay out most of the time
so we'll just go there to sleep
we just need a place where we can sleep and relax
uh are you also um do you mind if the place is a little bit crammed and uh you know not so large but uh in a
yah that's fine
in a nice place of town
so we just need two beds and um a decent bathroom
yes that's right
and i don't need a television that's fine
they usually come with a television
really
okay
so that's fine
that will be perfect
do you enjoy staying in chinatown or little india
uh you know those uh what we call ethnic heritage areas
wow
okay interesting
so let me see
so you step out you can get chinese food or indian food
we also have good class hotels there also
really
the
so long as i can go to the mall i mean just walking distance so i can easily walk if i want to go to a restaurant or if i need to shop
if you are
clothes
okay
if you're talking about a mall are you talking about modern shopping centre or we have also street side shopping
small shops
small shops
that will be fine
okay i'm gonna get you hotels in chinatown
okay
sure
just
so that's great that i can spend one thousand singapore dollars
yes you would save a lot of money shopping
really
because we're worried that we need more than that
so that's a good news then
uh we have a good range in singapore
you could spend it in one day
you could spend it in a week
in a week really
alright
yes
if your hotel is not too uh expensive
okay
let's see huh
right
because we're planning to spend our money to you know to buy food and clothes and whatever
just okay are you getting the screen now
yes i can see it
so
furama city centre
i can see it
affordable prices yes
this is chinatown
which i think is quite interesting
i will get you little india later if you want
sure
but chinatown is uh you know you can walk out and buy things from the shops
you can also walk to the nearest uh train station
and get down to orchard road
you could walk to your bus by the river
right
okay
so i can see the uh i think
okay
do you see keong saik hotel
this one
yes the cheapest one
okay
i'm not saying anything
i just thought that uh so have more money shopping
yah
yah i can see you pointing it
uh huh so that's for ninety dollars
yes
alright
and then
let's say well that's just these are all um clean hotels
you know they are usually
do they have good feedback from their customers
feedback you will have to google maybe and find out
you see it has only twenty five rooms
yah that's fine
so let me see
it's a boutique hotel actually do you see the hotel description
i got my arrow there
right
so what they've done is they converted all shop houses into hotel rooms so the hotel rooms are not uh very wide
perhaps uh you can get off uh your hotel room in about fifteen minutes
go and have breakfast at the little shops nearby
wow
and uh you know you could but the shops open a bit later
maybe about ten o'clock
ten
alright that's fine
yah right
even the malls they start up at about ten o'clock in the morning
uh huh
but how long would it take if i'll walk is it possible for us to walk from the hotel to the nearest mall
can you give me the nearest mall in that hotel
uh depends
so that we can shop
mall oh yes you could walk down to central mall which is
central mall
by the singapore river
one of our latest malls
alright
and uh you overlook the singapore river if you uh for example have a ice cream in one of the there's an ice cream boutique there
there's also um coffee joints
alright
so that i think i'll take that place then
yah ninety dollars only right
and yah that's fine
that will be perfect so that we can spend our money um with food
we can buy more food and clothes
alright but anyway
yes
yes and you could hang out at the bars
how far is sentosa from that hotel
uh not far
uh you can uh just walk to the nearest train station
which is tanjong pagar
and then you can take the train
westwards
uh huh
and uh you get off at harbourfront
and there you can take a shuttle into sentosa
uh really
but uh can you tell me how much will be how much do we need to pay for the fare
oh it's very low
i don't have the exact fare it goes by distance
but what i advise is you get a card when you come in
at changi airport you go to the mrt station and you collect you pay in advance for a card with stored value
and then before you go back you'll get your change if you hand it back in
unless you want it as a souvenir
alright but
so you're only paying as a singaporean would pay
uh huh
but how much do we need to spend if we'll take the mrt all the time
um how much do we need to allot for that
if you are taking the trains and the buses
transportation
i think just maybe twenty dollars or even less
it's a it's because of the deposit you have to pay but you're getting it back once you hand in the card
it's for the manufacture of the card
hm i see
so let's say
so if you are not intending to bring it back you know uh it's it's just the distance travelled and i think you will spend on travel maybe only ten dollars or so
unless you're travelling all the time and you're not
heading off and shopping or eating you know
alright
or probably we can allot a hundred just to be safe for the fare
oh
no
is that too much
no you don't need so much if you are using buses than train
oh perfect
yah
the only thing is if you take the train ride round singapore um you have and you get off say one stop from your hotel
uh you will have to pay a two dollar surcharge
uh for using the train for too long because we don't want people to hang out in the trains
that's all
alright
but if we're going out at night maybe you can suggest some restaurants or bars that we can visit
uh restaurants or bars
you are thinking of what kind of food
hm we love to try authentic food from singapore
do you take oh yes
great authentic food
let me see
can you suggest a restaurant
yes
uh you know where you are in chinatown
we have a very old market that has been spruced up and it's one of my favourite places to eat
we have also muslim food there and indian food but people go there for chinese food
uh let me try and see which there
sure
and how much do i need to pay for a meal for example
if you add a lot of food ten dollars will go a long way
yes
oh really
ten dollars
okay
that's a lot
let's say if you bought uh different things and you tried it on
assuming you have a big appetite
uh let me see if i can get this uh take a look
sure
uh maxwell market
food centre let's see can you see maxwell food centre there
sure
yes i can see it
okay
now it's actually on the edge of the business district and chinatown
oops
and it would be within walking distance
great
from your hotel
and really you even if you stay somewhere else this is a good place to try uh local food
and you should go there different times of the day because in the morning you will get some stores that only sell up to lunch
and there are some open at dinner time and supper time
uh huh
wow
and we've got noodles we've got rice
there are also
uh vegetarian stalls and uh fish soups if you are thinking of something healthy
uh you do you have dietary needs
do you
any of you
uh no that's fine
we eat everything
my best friend is always hungry so that we need to find the perfect restaurant
oh so that's good
besides going to the market there would be stalls just outside your hotel
wow that's great
uh actually i should tell you that uh your hotel is located in what uh maybe eighty years ago was a red light district
but it's full stop now
so around that area there are many uh food stalls uh and uh coffee shops we call them actually
wow okay that will be great
but can you suggest more activities that we can do together aside from malling and eating
uh you want to go to uh you was you mentioned the beach earlier right
right
so i'm gonna get sentosa for you
can i oops just a minute
sentosa
how far is sentosa from our hotel
okay let me get back the okay now
you see where you are you could walk to the uh mrt station
and uh you could are you getting sentosa on your screen
yes i can see it now
so where you are is let me see tanjong pagar
about maybe two just a minute uh let me get on the train
sure
uh can you see tanjong pagar
uh right at the bottom on the green line
right
are you getting it
okay
you go on the green line
and you go to outram park
and then you switch to the north east line
the purple line
you just go one stop and you're at harbourfront
right
and then you can just ask anybody for directions
the bus bay where sentosa operates shuttle buses into sentosa on a regular basis
right
oh i see
uh or you could take an express then you have to go that in fact there's a huge shopping area there
there are two shopping malls there vivocity and harbourfront
harbourfront is the older one
at vivocity on the top floor you can get an express light rail system direct into sentosa
wow perfect
but the easier way is you just go to the foot the bus bay because at the bus bay again you can get a lot of variety of food
malay this time you get more of the malay uh that means uh muslim food and indian food
there's also lot of chinese stalls food stalls
right
right
uh the people who work at harbourfront at the malls they often go across the road to where the bus terminal is to get their food
so it's nice to check it out you know check it out first
and if you still want to take the express train you could
you could cross the road and you make your way to vivocity and you can take the train in
otherwise you can take the shuttle
i think it cost about a dollar only extra on you
wow
a dollar would be perfect
but how much do i need to pay if i'll go to sentosa
for the do you have any entrance fee or do i need to to get there
yes
yes there are
if you'll go and swim it's just two dollars to enter
but if you enter the attractions then you have to pay more
i would like to try the cable car
do i need to pay extra for that
yes
you need to actually the good thing is to get uh what do you call it
get to the top of mount faber which is near to harbourfront
and uh buy or buy a uh sort of a package
and from the package you can get lower price entry to all the attractions
alright
oh let me show you some of the attractions first
sure
because the they are packaged in such a way that you know if you like adventure
you'll see imbiah lookout
yes
if you take the cable car
you end up there on the island
imbiah lookout is the is the stop
and it's on a little hill
wow that's great
from there you can walk to the butterfly park
uh you could uh take a little ride you know on this little like sling down the little hill but this is a concrete trail
and they have a short cable car there but you want to take the main one across the harbour right
right
so when you're there you can check out all the places there
there are you could walk to the beach from there too
alright
so
and there's a museum in what used to be uh former british military hospital converted to museum
i suggest you visit that
um it's called images of singapore
let me see if it's shown here
sure
because images of singapore gives you uh the
what can i see there
it's uh the history of singapore
wow
alright
so we love to see that as well
and
now on beaches you'll see what you see now
do you see the dolphins
yes
yah and now do you see universal world
uh huh
if you like to go to universal studios you could visit that
that would
cost a bit more money
yah like how much do i need to spend for that
can you give me an estimate so that i will know how to budget my money
maybe i say about fifty dollars or hundred dollars
hm each alright
uh let me see
can i get universal studios for you to get it more accurately/
so sure
because there are rides that you can take there
right
so that's why we're not really spending too much for the hotel because we want to go around the city and make the most of it
but two days is a little short
i think you need uh five days
okay
yes
probably next time
okay
universal studios huh
wow resorts world
so if you stay there you would use up your thousand dollars very quickly
a thousand
alright
no i mean the hotel there would be you know more than a hundred dollars
alright
so we have these rides
are you into rides
i mean um
not really
yah
so if you went and took these rides then it would cost more
but
i think she's not really into casino so that's fine if
yah
so yes that would save you a lot of money
alright
so but we're planning to spend the rest of the day in that place in sentosa
however um how far is marina bay from sentosa
uh it's a different area altogether
is that really far
uh you have to get out of sentosa island first
and then uh you have to take public transport
okay
let me try to get you uh do you have the map now
sure
yes i can see it
so marina bay you're lucky because the train has just uh connected to marina bay
that's good
so you would be at harbourfront when you're on sentosa
so you connect with the blue line
you could either continue to dhoby ghaut and then switch to the red line
and uh that is also fun
because dhoby ghaut is a major interchange and there are lot there's a huge shopping mall there
so you might want to spend some time there before you change to the red line
wow
and go south to marina bay
the red line is the newest line
it's the circle line but it hasn't you know uh it doesn't really form a circle here
um can you suggest some activities that we can do at marina bay aside from we can swim as well and um drink
what else can we do there
anything that is um fun or exciting
uh do you like concerts
oh yah
sure
that will be great
i don't have the date with me but uh we can check out that
esplanade do you see esplanade
then stop here
right
we have major theatres there
uh esplanade theatres on the bay
uh theatre and a concert hall
and we have shows there
alright
is it for free or do we need to pay
alright
uh we have lunch time concerts but that would be like once a month so
uh huh
it may not coincide with the time you are coming but let me see
april sixteenth
yah
okay let me see
okay
yah
yes okay
uh huh
okay
esplanade theatres on the bay
uh huh
no events
i'm sorry
oh too bad
yah
uh they are built like the old style microphones that have the um the rounded tops so it's like two big caps uh on the water let me see
let me just see if i can get you some photos here
sure
here you go
have you got it
yes i can see it
it's wonderful
it's nice to just go there and take photos
and there are lot of shops in there too
um the shops would be not like your chinatown type
they would be
uh huh
uh huh
uh good quality shops. uh
very nice place to hang out
uh huh
uh what did you say
your date was uh weekend
is it a weekday
um not sure
i just booked on the sixteenth
i'm not really sure
i don't have the calendar right now
april sixteenth
april sixteenth
april sixteen let me check
ah you coming on a monday
it's a saturday
no sixteenth is a monday and
oh let me see
oh monday sorry
i was looking at twenty one
sixteen monday
yah
no that is a i'm not sure what they have uh on those dates right now
uh okay
just a minute
that mean
is it much better to stroll in a weekend or weekdays
uh weekend is more um fun
it is more full of activities
and when we are celebrating certain festivals like chinese new year or the christmas there are lots of free performances just in the concourse area
really
what about next month
don't you have any
uh let me see uh
festivals next month
yah i'm trying to find it on their own website
sure
grounds all events
okay
okay
march
oh dear don't tell me they only gave it for this month
oh i think we need to reschedule our flight
you have
you
you oh you can have a look at just to get an idea of what is on right now
so you have an idea of what we have
uh huh alright
alright i'll take note of the website
and maybe on the first of january you try it when you uh first of april i mean
but what is the peak season in singapore
just like in our country it's um around summer time or
uh it's usually school holiday time for the countries nearby and
december
uh singaporeans also travel so uh rather move around singapore's attractions
so we just had the school holidays over
so that was one week of busy time at the shopping malls and the
attractions
uh april i think they've all gone back to school
so uh it would not be so crowded it would be quite relaxed
alright
wow
perfect
especially on a monday and tuesday i think uh
i find it a little bit too crowded down at orchard road on the weekends
because everybody likes to go there
right
so i think it will be perfect
i will just go there on the sixteenth
no need to reschedule
okay
uh are you getting the schedule now for april
uh i'm afraid the background is black so
sixteenth
let me see huh
sixteenth
oh sorry
okay
we got a music concerto
what uh oh this is interesting
did you see this
yah
south mother africa
right
so that will be on the sixteenth
yes it's a twelve to oh no twelve to
fifteenth
uh no fifteenth
okay let me check
no sixteen
there's no event on the sixteenth
too bad
there's dance workshop on the seventeenth
oh wednes
the next day
monday
they take a break on monday
alright so maybe we'll try the next day
yah unless you're into dance and dance workshops on the seventeenth
that's what we have
that will be interesting then
you want me to open this up for you
yah sure please
okay so three hour workshop
and it's only fourteen dollars
wow it's very cheap
so i think we should take that as well
i'll take note of that
and the person conducting i think
are there restrictions in your country like are we allowed to just stay at stay out uh around one a.m. or two a.m. or that's fine if we just stay until the next day
you can stay as long as you like but i don't think uh sentosa would like you to sleep on the beach
that's all
right so
so when we have a beach party they tell people that you know in the mornings we have the shuttle buses to go out
what time will they close then
the beach
uh actually i don't know about that you know
but maybe the lifeguards will come around
there are more worried about safety
uh huh
so probably around six or seven in the evening
oh you could stay later than that because we have beach bars
wow
alright
um but you know being sentosa the prices will not be the same as um let's say chinatown
uh huh
uh hm let me see
but okay
if i can get the beach
sure
sentosa beach bars
there you go
so i hope they have an event on the sixteenth too
okay
ah usually it's on weekends we have
here you are
okay
see
wow it's a nice place
so this is a bit more
can we go snorkelling
pardon
snorkelling
can we do that do you have extra activities
can we do that do you have extra activities
you could but frankly uh you would have to take a trip to the island
uh one of our outer islands to do snorkelling uh there's not much underwater wildlife on that beach
i mean it's merely for swimming
uh because that's what we want to do
so can you suggest a place where we can go snorkelling
uh snorkelling
let me see uh you would need to go with uh somebody who organises it i would suggest
uh huh
and i also think you should stay longer because otherwise it's one whole day
yah
yah it's okay if we'll stay there for the whole day and then we can just shop the next day because our flight is at night
so we can maximise our time
uh no i'm afraid the organisers in singapore organise for outside singapore
oh too bad
there is one place uh at sisters island but the waters there are quite rough
oh
and i'm not sure because i don't snorkel myself uh or rather i uh frankly i don't snorkel in singapore
oh really
you haven't tried it
no because over there it's too rough for me huh
i don't swim
i got to snorkel in very shallow water
so i have to go to places where the fish come up to your feet you know uh in very little water
so
uh huh
can you give me an estimate let's say if i'll take advantage of this service or this package
so that i'll have an idea how much do i need to save for this
snorkelling
you need to hire a boat and uh wait uh
sure
let me try to see if they have it somewhere else here
sure
cause i don't want to give you wait sorry
an estimate will do
so
but i heard that if you really want to shop um nice gadgets or affordable gadgets we can just go to singapore
is that true
yes uh you should bring extra money if you are buying like uh
yah
lap you know if you are buying laptops or you are buying something expensive then you know your thousand dollars will not uh accommodate that
let me see
uh hm
right
it's a pity
i have a niece who go snorkelling
and she would yes singapore
really
uh huh
okay
you should try that too that's fun
oh no it's the island i'm referring to is too dangerous for me i know
or maybe the tourist guide can just help us
uh here there
do you see this
wow
uh and i have friends who go uh surveying
they're actually doing it for nature
okay
so the waters frankly in singapore are not so clear
the variety i'm told is good for singapore waters
uh huh
uh huh i see
so i think we just need to skip snorkelling and we just need to go around the city and try some food
yes uh i have to be frank with you um
yah thank you for that
you can use singapore as a base to maybe indonesia or malaysia and try snorkelling there
if you are you know very keen on seeing if you like you need to see the fish right in your eye
uh hm
uh hm
colourful corals ah
right
but if i want to buy some gadgets where should i go
hm what are you thinking of buying actually
um i think my best friend she wants to buy a new laptop
and cameras
laptop i suggest you go to this place called funan centre
it's a it mall
it mall
okay
yah
okay
are they on sale next month
will they be on sale next month
let me get into the website
usually what i advise people to do is to okay you have a picture of the mall there
yes i can see it
go to the various shops and ask for the price of the item you want to buy and tell them frankly that you are price checking so they will give you the best price
and then after you walk around you can come back to the first shop
uh huh
alright
so i think we should go there as well
and how far is that from our hotel
how long would it take for us to reach that area
hm you said you are good at walking right
right
you could walk there
oh
or you could take
would that take us for an hour or
no i think maybe forty minutes or thirty minutes
forty minutes
or you could um get on the street that is uh facing the direction out of your hotel the main street
uh hm
and just take a bus maybe two stops and you would be there
uh hm i see
but i'm just curious um how much do i need to pay if i'll take the cab
because i notice that you've been suggesting that i should take the mrt or because
cabs are about three dollars upwards
three twenty upwards uh and it's a we have some surcharges if you leave early in the morning like when everyone is going to office
those are the peak hours
and in the evenings
but because we have the buses running also full steam and the trains they agreed if you miss the train this morning it was two minutes before the next train came
hm i see
so i think it's really it's also more fun for you you know
you'll get to see the local people
how we move around
um and where you are
like you i have told you it's so well connected
you have lots of buses lots of trains
i see
alright
the taxis uh in chinatown you have to go to a taxi stop uh to pick the taxi
uh huh
but uh which is safe
um is it safe to take the cab or the mrt instead
yes uh it's as safe in both
you just don't take all your bling and hang it all around you
uh i don't think you'll be doing that right
uh just take the usual precautions
alright
right
that uh like i said you can't you can book the cab from your hotel or you can get reception to call you a cab
but if you are sort of walking around chinatown you need to find a cab station you know a taxi stand to get your cab
they are not allowed to stop any and everywhere
hm i see
but i'm just wondering if you can suggest a place where i can buy souvenirs
cheap souvenirs
oh
chinatown would be the best place
uh there are street stalls and there are also shops
but like i said you might want to walk around the whole place first
and find out
but usually in chinatown they are more or less the same price for the cheap souvenirs like three items for ten dollars
hm not bad i think
and there would be different sort of items
alright
so i think um you were able to answer my questions and thank you for being patient because i have i asked you a lot of questions today
um i'm very sorry i can't uh give you better news on snorkelling
uh huh that's fine
but you can come to singapore and use the services of the companies that organise for singaporeans to go snorkelling nearby
you know and it would not be expensive you know
alright
i see
but um can you give me some tips or what are the things that i should remember if i go to your country so that the police will not call my attention or
uh say again
sorry
uh hm
uh huh
can you give me some tips that i mean the things that i need to remember so that you know i will not commit mistakes or nothing bad will happen if i go there
uh huh
okay
like i know that we can't chew gums and we can't smoke everywhere so what else maybe
you can chew gum in singapore you just cannot import gum
that's the miscon you can bring in gum but if you brought in a whole carton uh the customs would will take it away from you because they will assume you are selling it
so if you bring gum for two days and say it's for my personal use i don't think anyone will stop you
uh the only thing is when you dispose of your gum you have to make sure it's wrapped up and thrown in a bin
or some people carry a little plastic bag and put it in the handbag until they find a proper dustbin to throw it
uh you also some tourist carry a little do you smoke
oh yes
so you know they have a little gadget for holding your ashes when you are smoking
uh i've seen a tourist used it
i thought it was very cute
you so that you can smoke uh at designated areas but if there's no bin to dispose of your cigarette after you smoke you just keep it back in the container
it's just so that you don't break the anti-littering law
right
although most of the time nobody gets caught
so uh singapore may not be as clean as you imagine it to be
right
uh the restaurants also uh they have a restriction on the place where you can uh eat and smoke
so it's usually outdoors
so it will be clearly marked out
so you have to seat in that area which means if there are only 3 tables and they are taken then you have to go to a non-smoking area and you cannot smoke there
okay
alright
so great and thank you for helping me jeanne and i think one thousand dollars will be enough for me
right maybe we just need to bring extra money then
bring extra money for shopping is it
right
uh there you still have some time with me so if you want to ask anything else
uh shall i go to some other sites for you
let me go down
okay
uh clarke quay
okay you mentioned uh okay
not spelt it correctly
the bar hopping i remember
alright
yah
we missed that
yes
so i'm going to clarke quay
oh clarke quay bar
no this one is for
okay
i'm just curious how much do we need to pay if we'll drink
uh actually on a weekday
i'm not sure if it's tuesday or wednesday
some bars have a women's night
wow
where you get it free
the only thing is you have to dress like a woman
uh huh
of course
they have uh refused to let some women in who were dressed uh not like women if you get what i mean
uh and uh senior citizens
did they get discounts too senior citizens
no they you see they want the ladies to attract the men there
oh that's why
so uh
he
they're giving drinks for free
yes the ladies get in for free
usually the cover charge is maybe twenty dollars or
a weekday is lower than uh weekends
maybe just fifteen dollars
alright
oh that's good
buy one get two cocktails
uh see can you see here
uh let me try and get it here
there you go
right
okay
good
and lunch a lunch at clarke quay unless they have changed it it's only about fifteen plus
uh at clarke quay
i've done a walk there myself and uh i was very tempted to go in and eat
so tuesday is drivers night huh
right
okay that's good
i don't know how you oh you got to be a certified then
do you see this
drivers night
yah yes i can see it
so if you have your driver's license
no too bad
if you know
oh
free flow house pour jug
the whole jug at thirty dollars
usually it's the wednesday night that's on wednesdays and thursdays
on wednesday
alright so let's see if we can still adjust the flight
so that we can take advantage of the ladies night wednesdays
that is uh yes
hm and i suggest you stay a little bit longer because it will allow you to see more things
alright okay
so maybe one thousand will really help me
one thousand dollars will be really good for us
so i bet my best that i'll bring extra money to get the most of it
that will be perfect
you you may yes for your shopping and uh you might have extra money to go home
or you could you know fill up with your shopping
let me see if i can get orchard road shops for you huh
uh huh
yah sure
will it be really hot next month in your country
um it's hot and sometimes wet throughout the year
so yes my advice is to bring a cardigan more for the you know if you go in the bars sometimes they're cold or the restaurants
or the air conditioning within uh certain areas
uh let me see here
okay
sure
the outside area would not be hot uh would not be cold
although uh these few months we had some cold evenings which is very nice if you enjoy walking out in the open
wow
so in the evening times many people go out and walk because they find it well firstly if they work in day they have time only in the evenings
alright
yes so here you see a scene of the light up
can you see it works
wow
amazing
that's at christmas time
uh you come to see the light up
uh 5huh
wow
but at the time you come you can we are now linking up the shops in orchard road so um it's not hundred per cent connected but like maybe eighty per cent
you can walk from mall to mall without getting wet
and as you say you enjoy walking
right
it's not a problem
so we have the high-end gucci
we have also in bet in some other shopping centres we have uh non-branded items
right
so maybe we can just take pictures
and look around
no you can buy
like i said there are shops uh that are not gucci and cartier
um have you heard of things like g2000
yes
yes uh
i think we also have that store in this in our country
they are regular
uh hm regular brands
and you can buy your souvenir t-shirts in chinatown
perfect
alright
so i think that will be all for today jeanne
and thank you for helping me and i was able to find a very cheap hotel so perfect
i hope you'll come and uh stay a few more days
uh huh
right
yah
sure
yah
bye julie
alright
oh thank you

um and do you have a hotel in mind
um no actually
so you need to look for a hotel
uh hm yes

okay
it's called the botanical gardens
and also um lynnette could you also um please show me a um uh you know my best friend and i really loves partying and uh um we're won we're also wondering if there are um clubs or uh you know bars in singapore that we can definitely go
okay sure
thank you
so do you want me to show you the gardens first
or what do you want
yah sure
okay the gardens first
yah the gardens first
alright
okay
this is the botanical gardens in singapore
okay
you can be there as early as five a.m. to twelve midnight but i guess you won't be spending that many hours there
yah oh well um you know uh taking photographs will be good um for uh around six o'clock in the morning and up to nine o'clock in the morning because of the uh uh the natural colours will be great to the camera
okay
so you can be anyway the park opens as early as five a.m
uh hm yes
alright
uh so you can be there
alright and anytime you are ready to leave you can leave the gardens
alright
okay
but if you have if you plan to spend a bit more time you can go to the orchid garden inside the botanical gardens
but that is there is an admission charge there
but the orchid garden only opens at eight thirty
oh
so do you know what you're going to see in the orchid garden
um yah i suppose
um orchids and would there be any other plants there
uh majority would be orchids
hm alright
okay
but the botanical gardens you will have all the other plants out in the botanical garden including a small jungle
uh hm perfect
that will be perfect
yes
and there will be some birds uh there as well
okay
so this is for the garden visit for your plants and a little bit of wildlife like the birds uh so you can do that in the morning
hm alright that's great
okay
okay
so is there any other information that you require for the uh photography session
um i think that will be all
okay
do you need me to tell you how to get there
and yes please
okay
now assuming that your hotel is somewhere in orchard road there are buses available
these are the buses available
uh there are quite a number of buses it's all stated on the website
okay if you want to take the mrt train station mrt the subway trains
um yes
uh yes
it is also possible
um but what if we uh take the mrt station
do we have to take any other vehicles or we just have to walk
uh yes
you're actually right there at the eco uh garden
this is at the north end of the gardens
hm okay
yah it's quite close to the garden already
great
yah
otherwise if you uh because there are many entrances and exit to the garden itself
yah
so uh it's fine if you take the mrt you can arrive at the uh mrt uh the botanical garden station
uh okay
okay so
so we can close this uh website
yes
okay
so next we want to go to the uh universal studio
yes
can you please show me around
okay sure
okay this is uh some of the photos that you can get uh to do when you see the uh hollywood characters
so your main period yes
oh
um well i'm just gonna ask if the universal studios is near from the botanical garden
uh you it is uh the so are you thinking of after your morning photography student uh studio uh photography session to proceed straight to the universal studio
um yes
okay
uh it is not that far away
alright
what you can do is you go back on the mrt
hm yes
and you take the circle line
okay
uh and you will alight at the harbourfront
yes
and then um
yes
in harbourfront you will uh get in using the uh the sentosa express
alright
to get into the universal studio
yes
uh alright
so um again after uh we ride the mrt it is straight to the universal studios entrance so we don't have to ride another uh another bus or any other vehicles
uh no from the botanical garden it's um mrt and you can change the sentosa uh train at harbourfront

yah
so that's how you can get in
and straightaway when you alight uh at the station uh to by taking the sentosa express you're already at universal studio

these are the tickets here
okay and these are the rides that's available
are those rides uh are those rides inclusive of the uh entrance fee or do we have to pay uh another uh for that for the rides
no the most of the rides are included unless they say that for example like the uh amber rock climb
that's uh additional charges for the children
this one is for the children
okay
uh otherwise most of the rides would be already included in your ticket
hm okay
alright
okay
hm alright
so uh the i think the transformer ride is very interesting
uh hm yes
okay
alright so this is the universal studio
and how much time do you think you want to spend there
um well i think um well just before dinner
oh before dinner
yah
alright
okay
so in the night time you want to do uh you want to go to a bar
yah
alright
okay
so you can go to this very famous bar
it's called zouk
zouk club
z o u k
okay yah
zouk club
yes
okay this is the park
yah this is a club
alright
okay
these are some of the events the past event
okay
yah
do you need me to tell you the dress code
um yes please
okay
dress code will be uh party attire
and because they have won uh few years
for a number of years they have won the nightspot of the year
it's a pretty good place actually
yes
okay
perfect place for partying and clubbing
did yah
and do you need me to tell you how to get there
um yes please
okay
again it's quite accessible by the uh subway train station
you just have to walk a little bit
the closest station would be uh at the tiong bahru mrt train station
okay
so actually it's a pretty big place and um from the um station from the mrt station uh we can definitely see the lights from the club right
uh it's about ten minutes walk from the mrt
well you don't have the lights out there
it's uh pretty uh simple on the outside so you don't see like a lot of uh new lightings
but it is uh one of almost uh world famous club uh in singapore
so if you want to party uh this will be one of the nightspot
oh
okay
okay
yah
okay
another club that i can uh recommend you will be called okay this is the other uh club
alright that uh we have in singapore
yes
which is again pretty uh popular with the local as well as the tourists
okay it's called one-altitude
oh um by the way lynnette um
yes
uh the uh what do you call this
um uh at what usual time does the op you know the clubs open at night
okay usually people would start going in by ten o'clock
alright
and it finish late like till two a.m
two a.m. yah
this is about the usual time that people goes to the club
uh hm okay
and the other uh club that i like to introduce you would be called one-altitude
wow
okay
so this is uh you have top of the world feeling
this is it's actually a bar
a gallery and bar
it's really uh a pretty nice bar
yes
you got a good view uh from the top of the building
alright
um and how do we get there
okay again this is very accessible by the mrt
you alight at raffles mrt
raffles place mrt and it's just right there
uh huh
hm okay
okay
okay so you have two clubs to go to already
is it and also lynnette um we also plan on the second day uh if you happened to know um where we can buy uh branded clothes but you know for cheaper prices
okay
alright
we have along orchard road lots of shopping
and also if you can please show me um how to get there uh from our hotel
okay
thank you
let me just show you this
okay
now this is a shopping complex called paragon
okay
uh it is located on orchard road
and the closest mrt train station would be called orchard station
it's just five minutes walk from orchard station
okay that's great
alright
so this is one option other the other option so you have all the branded goods out there
and because you are a tourist now when you buy something from a bigger company
uh remember to get the gst tax refund
gst tax refund
it's the it's the vat you know
but we call it gst here
it stands for goods and services tax
alright
okay when you get the form uh you can always claim back the seven per cent upon uh you leaving singapore
oh and um where do i claim that
okay
now if you are going to put your purchases in your handbag
alright
it's okay
you will check-in as usual at the check-in counters
okay
after you get your boarding pass you go inside the immigration
okay
immediately after the immigration you will be able to see a big sign that says gst
oh okay
okay just approach counter with your purchases and your uh receipt alright that has been stamped uh by the retailer and you present this to the officer
and they will be able to refund you your money in whatever currency you wish
or to uh mail back the uh refund to you via your uh credit card to credit back your gst uh to your credit card
so it's very easy
oh okay
yes
okay
if you want to put your purchases in your luggage then it's slightly different
um well do you have do i have to go to the uh straight to the immigration and um you know refund the gst again to that counter or would there be any other process for that
okay
what you can do is your purchases are going to be put inside your luggage when you arrived in the airport
okay
at both ends of uh at one end of the airport area you will find a gst counter
okay
now bring your purchases your uh receipt to the and of course your passports and tickets
and bring it to the officer that's located there
okay
present all these items and the officer will do a stamp for you
okay now bring everything to do your normal check-in at the check-in counter
okay
once you have done your check-in with your boarding pass proceed into the immigration counter and you look for the gst sign again and you will be able to get back your tax refund
okay
okay
uh sounds easy
oh thank you
yah
okay
alright
so that's how you claim back the gst
gst
yah thank you for that lynnette
and okay so this is one uh shop but to the shopping again for your branded goods
this would be one of the options
i think the prices here for branded goods are still uh very competitive
alright
now another shopping centre you may want to consider would be a nice shopping centre called ion
in the um is it close to the uh paragon shopping centre
yes
uh park
close to the park
sorry which
no um the paragon shopping centre
oh yes
again this is just this is even nearer to the orchard mrt train station
when you exit from the mrt uh this is the shopping centre
now well if i'm coming from the uh paragon shopping centre
uh do i have to ride anything or we can get there by just walking
yes just a five minutes walk
oh okay
alright
so you are just very close-by to one another
and do you want me to recommend another shopping centre for you
yes please
you know because my best friend really love shopping and
okay
she goes crazy over um shoes
okay
this is another shopping centre here called ngee ann city
okay
okay it's just again on orchard road
it's just beside ion
uh you have ion then you have another shopping centre called wisma atria
and then you have this big shopping centre called ngee ann city
okay so does your friend only wants to do uh shoes the branded shoes
um well actually um any kind of clothing
um uh from dresses uh blouses t-shirts you know oh for souvenirs also
okay there is a sh uh on the ground floor there is a shop that sell some uh local souvenir
in ngee ann city
so you can get some uh souvenirs out there
okay otherwise i have given you the categories of the shops that is found in uh ngee ann city
so for example if you are looking for uh fashion accessories
okay these are all the various shops that has all the fashion
okay can you see from high fashion
yes
okay to uh midrange as well
leather goods
okay
uh midrange kind of leather goods will be u.r.s. okay on pedder
okay the rest are high-end branded goods
okay
oh so um i think we can definitely find everything that um we want to buy there at ngee ann city
yes
so how about food wise
uh what kind of food do you like
um uh actually we would like to try singaporean foods
okay singaporean food
yah okay
okay
then you go to next door called wisma atria
there is a food court
and you can try some of our local street food out there
hm and um well actually we don't have any idea what to try there
so um uh you know i was wondering if you do have uh one in mind that you can definitely uh refer us to try
okay
uh okay
the wisma atria is called uh food republic
yah
uh and one of the local food that i would like to recommend you would be fried hokkien noodles
oh was that fried
sorry
um oh was that i'm sorry i didn't get that
uh fried hokkien noodle
uh hm okay
so basically what is it made of
uh this is actually made out of the yellow kind of noodles
yah
can show you how it's done hokkien noodles
this one
wow it has prawn on it
i think that would be perfect because we both love seafoods
um lynnette
yes
i think that's enough right
okay
so basically we fry this uh dish
hm yah
okay
so uh okay i think we have enough of the food otherwise we get too hungry
yes
okay and now what's uh so let's go back to uh paragon again
yup
okay
alright
so that's too uh attract you to try this local food out here that is very popular in singapore
uh of course we have a lot more uh dishes
um okay
uh for example we have satay in singapore
satay
yah
it's a meat different kind of meat that is pierced through a skewer and it's barbecued over uh charcoal
okay
uh yes
that is something you want to consider as well
oh let me put that on my list
i'll definitely try that
and of course our very famous uh chicken rice
chicken rice
alright
yah
um would that all i guess that will be uh that will cover up our two days trip in singapore
okay
so uh do you still need to do some more photography session
um uh well do you have any place uh any more places um besides the botanical garden that uh you know that's great for um photography
okay
we have another place called uh the uh sungei buloh or even bukit timah hill
okay
do you like to do a little bit of uh climb
um yah
okay
so i can recommend you bukit timah hill
and basically what are the uh you know what can i basically see there
okay bukit timah hill is singapore tallest hill
oh
alright
yes
and uh again there are lots of flower and fauna
a bit of uh a bird's life
okay
but i would say it's small birds and fauna
and it is popular with the local who goes for the morning or evening walk up the hill
okay
and um also how do we get there um assuming we're coming from the um hotel
okay
okay
you will have to take a bus
because right now the mrt is not ready at this moment
so you will have to take a bus to go there
okay this is uh just a photo scene
lots of trees
wow
okay
uh of course you will get to see some monkeys as well
uh do not touch them
okay so and you will have to take a bus called uh bus one seven zero from orchard road
and um how long would it take to get there
okay
uh allocate about uh forty minutes bus ride
from orchard
weighting time approximately about fifteen minutes to get to this park
well um well lynnette i think uh that will be all uh for uh our two days trip in singapore
and um basically that will cover most of um our trip
and uh and also uh by the way uh just one more thing
uh do you have any place uh well i have i've heard this from my uh from my sister's friend because they've been to singapore uh a place called little india
okay
yes we have this place called little india
and uh this is a ethnic area in singapore
alright
so traditionally uh the indians used to live here in the past
okay
okay i'm just going to show you some images of little india
okay can you see
it's a very colourful area
is it a market
uh on what kind of market are you talking about
pretty much uh any kind of market like uh anything goes around there
okay
there is a wet market in little india mrt train station
uh they sell it's like a non-air conditioned supermarket
so all the stores sells meat vegetables flowers uh and they open till twelve o'clock in the afternoon
so there is the market if i understand what do you mean by market
oh yes
okay
so would you want to try some indian food
um yes definitely
okay
now i'm going to show you this food
it's colourful right
yes
very colourful
okay
this is called indian rojak
so you would pick the different dishes that's uh available in the store
okay
and the vendor the food centre will cook for you
it's mainly deep fried
alright
and they serve you with this orange coloured gravy
um yes
yah
which is not that spicy
it just a tinge of uh spice in there
okay
and uh so it's like everything mixed together so we call this indian rojak
indian rojak
yah
now if you okay
so this is one dish
okay
and
okay
are you also uh do you want to eat other things
oh yes
in little india
yes
okay
uh we have like chapatti
is that also an indian food
uh yes
it's a kind of bread made from wheat flour
okay
and there's also other kinds of bread like uh curry naan
okay this is the picture of the bread the naan
okay you can eat it plain you can have garlic naan
so it's actually taste quite good on its own
you can dip them with curry
chicken saag curry mutton curry
and you can have another version uh of like pancake indian pancake that's called uh roti prata
okay
so these are quite typical uh indian food that we have here
so it's so colourful
i think you may also get good pictures down in little india
hm yah
very um very indian
with all the colours and also uh lynnette can you please show me uh around at um sentosa
okay
now sentosa uh universal studio is in sentosa
so basically it's um it's a city there and uh what else can i find there besides from the universal studios
alright
okay
it's a whole island of uh recreational uh activities that you can do there
okay so you have the beach
okay can you see the bottom part
that's the beach area
yah
um can you please um uh show me around the beach
the beach okay
we have a few beaches out here
yes
so i like to show you this pahlawan beach
okay this is the beach out on sentosa
this is called pahlawan
then we have siloso beach
okay these are basically lagoon so uh the uh it's a nice place and you can see people also playing uh beach volleyball
so and um also how do we get there
uh same thing
you can if you're on universal studio you can just take the beach uh the sentosa express the train on sentosa and you alight at the beach station
okay and you're at the beach
so it is better to do uh universal studio together with the attractions on sentosa
uh hm yes
and also what other uh aside from beaches what um other activities can we um find at sentosa
okay
you can do the spa
okay can you see the a number of spas there
would you do you like to do spa
um yes of course
okay
the mon uh there are about five spas that's available uh on the uh island itself
hm well i think that uh um i'm pretty curious about the fish reflexology underwater world
okay
okay
okay this uh fish reflexology it's uh like a foot massage
but they use the fish
so these fishes will actually eat up all your uh so called uh dead skin
and they so what you will feel is this nibbling ticklish uh sensation
so what the fish do is they nibble at your ni dead skin
oh
okay
so it's quite uh unique
i think we'll gonna try that
okay huh yah
so the cost do you want to know the cost
yes please
okay
now this uh they have different time uh kind of uh package
alright if it's uh forty minutes that would cost you thirty eight dollars per session
and uh fifty minutes will cost you fifty two dollars per session
and that fifty minutes um includes the full fee of the reflexology and also the massage
uh no it's just the uh fish nibbling at your feet
this is the fish reflexology over at the uh underwater world
oh okay
hm okay
okay
the uh there are other um for the if you want to do this fish reflexology uh you can actually combine it with going into the underwater world
because uh they charge for uh the okay can you see now
the fishes are you dip your feet into this pool and the fishes would nibble at your uh feet
and it's uh yes
yes
alright
and of course if you want to do body massage these are the various uh uh centres that you can uh do your body massage
okay
well um also in that uh just popped up in my mind
uh can you please um uh what about the uh night safari
okay
night safari uh opens in the night time
and where is it located
it is located in the north of singapore
you will have to take uh mrt and a bus
again again from the uh hotel
yes
okay
okay
so this is the uh night safari
wow
okay
that's also great for um our photographing session
uh okay
when you are inside the park because this is a park that opens in the night time
uh if you want to take photography uh you would have to take it without flash
oh okay
okay for if you're taking on the animals then you have to take that without the flash
flash
alright
yah
yah
i'll take note of that
and also lynnette uh do we have an entrance fee for that
yes
and how much it cost
does it cost
alright
okay
park
just for the uh night safari park right
uh hm yes
but basically lynnette what are what do i what should i expect to see h in the night safari
uh in the night safari you would see uh things like uh the giraffes
okay
uh the malayan tapir the leopards
okay
so these are the things that you're going to see in the uh night safari park
the uh okay
um okay
so these are the alright
alright
it should cost you about seventy uh two dollars
and uh you don't have to walk in the park if you don't want to
oh uh there is a uh what do you call that safari ride
yes
it's um tram
okay
uh huh
so you can get on the tram ride and uh you will see more than seventy per cent of the animals
and um the is it included in the uh ticket
yes the tram ride is included in the ticket
the whole ride will cost you forty minutes
okay
alright it will take about
alright it will take about it will take you forty minutes to go around the park
uh and if you don't want to take the tram you can do walking as well
hm but will i be ab if i if we choose to walk would we able to see um you know the uh the animals also
uh yes you can also walk
there are three trail that's one that you're looking at
it's called the leopard's trail
uh on this trail of course you see other animals but the highlight would be to see the leopard's trail
there is another called the fishing cat trail
uh this is located near the entrance area
and also um lynnette could you please um uh tell me more about the shows there at night safari
okay
there are uh two shows there
okay one is called the uh okay this show here
the first picture that you saw okay is the fire show
uh and the other one would be the creatures of the night
that's what you're looking at now
okay
okay
this is the uh okay this is the creature of the night
now basically it's a twenty minute show uh and they will just bring out some animals for you to see
the show timing would be in uh at seven thirty eight thirty and nine thirty uh provided it is not raining
okay
uh the other show the fire show will be at eight o'clock and nine o'clock
okay
and that the fire show is located outside the park
so once you get into the night safari you have to buy the tickets
okay
and you enter in
you can buy without the tram ride if you want to
uh but i would recommend that you take the tram uh and the walk
so uh so we just gonna um walk through the safari all our all by ourselves or do we have any guides there
okay
in the tram ride there will be a person a guide doing the commentary
uh what animals you are looking at
but on the walk uh you will be doing the walk by yourself
get to see about uh more than seventy per cent of the animals
oh okay
and the balance of thirty per cent you will have to do the walk to see the rest of the show
okay
so uh will there be any more um sites you know there in night safari
uh no more sites at the night safari but in the day time
we have the morning zoo which is next door
uh the morning zoo opens in the day
and you will be seeing a lot of the mammals
for example uh the orang-utans the chimpanzees
that can only be seen in the day zoo but not in the night safari
but uh are we allowed to take pictures of them
uh yes
because the day zoo it's only open in the day and the day you wouldn't require the flashlights right
uh yes
but uh during the night safari we are allowed to take um pictures but with no flash
yes
uh yes
you are allowed to take pictures of the animals without flash
but if you are going to just take your friends and plants or the entrance area uh then it is fine with the flash
okay
okay
alright
so i think uh we have covered uh do you have like uh you know uh more or less covered what you think you would like to do in singapore
um well i think uh we pretty much covered our two days trip in singapore um. and uh we really are excited to go there

and that would be
and that would be on the thirtieth of the said month
on in july
right
thirtieth of july okay

are you intending to come alone or you're gonna bring your family or friends
well i'm planning to go there alone because i just want to buy certain things you know things of interest yes
yah
you're buying yourself birthday presents huh
yes maybe
yah that could probably be it yes
and uh of course tour around the whole of singapore if it's possible yes
yes how many days are you intending to stay
oh i'm thinking maybe just a day or two
a day or two
yes
uh that may be a bit short you know even for shopping
it is
is it
yes
uh even for shopping it so uh how long how many days do you think it would take someone like me you know uh shopping in singapore
oh
what sort of shopping are you thinking or what sort of items
mainly electronic items yes
oh electronic
uh huh
well you talked about touring as well so maybe you want to see some of our attractions
oh sure yes
uh huh
uh attractions yes i would love to you know visit those uh famous places at uh most tourist uh most tourists visit right
but i have a question for you know since i would be planning on visiting uh shops
so
what would be uh the perfect place for an electronic shopper like me in singapore
uh i'm losing you a little bit
uh can you just say it
oh
yah
sure
can you hear me better now
yes this is much better
yes
okay
uh my question was uh for a person like me who likes electronic gadgets what would be the perfect place um yah
would be a perfect place for me to shop for gadgets
we have an it mall
it mall okay
yah it's called funan centre
and
funan centre
yes and it's easily accessible
okay that's wonderful
and uh when you say easily accessible can i walk to that place or
si depends on
yah
uh where depends on where you're staying
oh right
uh so
uh i've got a map here
yah i've got a map here
oh you've got a map right
thanks
of where funan centre is
and uh it's also near where we have old colonial buildings
so you have the address there
it says funan jewellery but don't worry about it
okay
it's uh it's uh it's the same place
so it's uh named differently on google maps
no i think the jewellery shop maybe had something to do with this
but it's in that locality
ah okay
so yah
i think i need i would need to uh ask for more information for my travel
uh and then my uh uh where i would stay
so let's say my point of interest is the it mall and funan centre
did i get that right
so if uh that is my first destination would be
ah okay
uh your voice quality is coming on and off
um i
coming on and off
you uh are you able now
this is much better
ah i'm sorry
this is better
uh i'm gonna give you the name of a hotel uh which is practically next door
okay just next door
yah
and you can see uh can you see it on the screen
uh is it the peninsula plaza
wait
uh yes that's a shopping centre also
wait penins
oh yes
oh yes
and you see coleman street is just uh perpendicular to north bridge road
uh huh yah
i can see that right
so uh it's only how many metres or miles away
how many yah
how far is it from funan centre
yah
uh about five minutes ten minutes if you walk fast
uh if you walks fast it's five minutes
oh yah i can see that on the map
wow that's very near and but uh i only have ah i'm sorry
i only have a hundred no one thousand singaporean dollars
it
uh your thousand singapore dollars is for your stay and your travel right
eh pretty much that yes
uh huh
so maybe che a cheaper hotel would be fine within the vicinity within the area near the funan centre that would be fine yes
che hum. uh let me see
hum. uh let me see
okay sure
take your time
uh just hold on a while
do you mind staying in chinatown
chinato oh well
hmm i like the chinese culture but um hm
yah this is a eh your hotel uh the funan centre is in fact within walking distance
you sound like a young man
uh can i just ask what is your age range
no problem
i am between twenty five and thirty
okay you can walk then
uh i just was found someone a hotel
yes
i'm physically able
you're physically able
yes
uh we have many places that are also uh accessible to people who have difficulty walking
uh huh
sure okay
i'm gonna show you the hotels in chinatown
sure
just a minute
okay
uh you were able to get it on the screen now
hmm yes i can see the red letters
i think those are the available hotels within the area
yes
yah you can see on the left-hand side a list of the hotels
yes the first one is chinatown hotel
uh eh at twelve teck lim road
yah
correct yes
yes that's a hundred and forty eight dollars
but uh
per is that a day
per day
yes a day
okay a hundred and forty eight
not bad i guess
uh does it come with i mean will my stay be inclusive of a breakfast meal or something like that
i'm not sure about that because anyway around there you can get a lot of um food
very reasonably priced food once you step out of the hotel
if you want to be adventurous and try street food chinese food by which i think filipino food is quite close right
i see
ah okay
okay
yes i love chinese food the chinese dishes too so i don't think i would have any problems with my uh you know appetite needs yes
so
okay let me try this other one
cheap hotels in sngapore
okay
uh huh
uh no no official shangri-la. hundred and twenty five hotels
there are cheaper hotels than that perhaps
there you go
can you see hundred and nineteen dollars
oh that's cheaper
at least thirty dollars cheaper than the uh chinatown hotel
the first one you did show me earlier right
i guess that's porcelain hotel it can see that it's
okay
yes
it's a good location
ah okay
so it's centrally located uh it's very accessible i can see that from here yes
and a five-minute walk from chinatown mrt station
okay
yes that's right
and you could walk to your funan mall
you could take a bus maybe two bus stops or one bus stop
alright
very nice
oh two bus stops
so i can't walk from
you can walk
i think for a able-bodied young man you could walk
eh i can
uh i could hm but uh how many minutes would it take me if i walk from that hotel to my destination funan centre
maybe ten or fifteen minutes
fifteen minutes slow walk okay
ten fif okay
not bad
not bad
you know what i like walking because it saves money
and it's good for your health right
no you get to see too right
yah exactly
can because i'm pretty sure that uh given the chance this is gonna be my first time to visit singapore i would prefer looking around and you know enjoying the sights yes
okay there's another hotel
uh do you see it
yes
uh i can see the m hotel

i can also use my phone right
oh okay
right
and how far is uh this uh hotel from hm
yah
uh could uh i'm losing you a little bit now

uh alright
so i got the hotel. i think um i'll uh book a day for my stay here right
so i got the hotel. i think um i'll uh book a day for my stay here right
this is a perfect uh hotel for me for just me yes
at fifty at fifty five you said it's fifty five right
so
yes let me see here
it was about you can put in a sixty dollars you know
it was about fif sixty yes
uh just round it up
yah round it up
just to be safe
right okay
so sixty dollars a day stay at santa grand got that
oh
hotel lai chun yuen
uh it is of i think uh it used to be a chinese opera house if they're using the name it should be
since they're using the name yah
i i see
so the building although uh how long or how old do you think is the main infrastructure where the building itself
yah
uh the building original building is pre-war
oh huh okay
yah pre-war but it they have all been um given up by their original owners and restored completely and in the case of the hotels they have been converted into hotels
so what happens is sometimes they buy up a few units and join them up
so
i see
i see
and
yah so they that's how they get you all the rooms uh with a on suite bathroom
yah the original buildings had one bathroom at the back
yah
i see. okay
i see. okay
but i don't think uh that's gonna be a problem now since it has been uh remodelled or renovated right
yes that's right
not a problem at all
not in singapore anyway
that's good
okay i know
alright
and the um i'm sorry the customer reviews
yah it says seven point five you see
uh in yah
yes
yes
which is good
yes it is
alright
and i think there's no i have a place to stay it's very near uh the location uh funan centre
it's nothing this um i don't have any problems with food because you said that you know when you step out of the building
uh i'm losing your voice now
okay
how about this time
yah now it's better
what is happening over there
is your microphone falling off
uh no actually my microphone is pretty much intact
i'm not sure why the audio is fluctuating
uh i'm on uh someone is assisting me now in the audio
okay
uh huh
okay
what else uh are you interested in
okay so funan centre is a place for electronic gadgets right
so i don't think i would need more assistance about that
i can uh pretty much uh do the shopping for myself
but after that um is there a museum nearby and how far is it uh
uh there's a new museum uh about three or five minutes walk away uh and it's the chinatown uh heritage museum
i don't know if they have a website
okay
uh let me list that down
it is interesting because uh it shows you but these old buildings were used for long long ago
how people lived
heritage muse
i see
uh do you have a website for that i can uh
yah i'm trying to get it now
okay hmm. and then the museum uh in the uh features like the chinese history i would assume
uh yes
uh not chinese history but the way of life in singapore
oh sorry
right
i'm sorry right
thank you
alright
it's okay
let me see huh
heritage centre
twenty
and it's just you know see this is how the chinese arrived from china and it gives you a very good insight
yes
but the pictures the preview pictures are quite
you see these were the conditions
okay
uh huh okay
great history of ah ah kuoi
yah they take personalities uh who used to live in that area
maybe not in the same room but they tell their story in there
i see
okay
so you can connect the transformation from that kind of room to your hotel room
i see
i get it. uh huh
i get it. uh huh
same kind of uh kind of building
you know what i mean
oh yah i get it
um hm okay
so
so it's uh sorry
chinatown heritage centre not museum okay
heritage centre yes
and how much is the entrance uh for this uh museum or this place
let me see
how much do i need to pay
yes
i think ten dollars is more than enough
it doesn't say here
accommodation visitor information right
uh it doesn't give the price but let me see okay
oh there ten dollars i'm right
okay spot on
thanks
alright
so ten dollars for an adult like me although i sound young
alright
an adult co an adult pass is ten dollars
alright
and
yah
and you see here uh
yes
sri mariamman temple
yes i can see sri mariamman temple
it's within walking distance of your hotel
wow okay
that's pretty convenient
i can walk there right and still i enjoy my travel just by walking yes
hmm and that it opens at nine a.m. to eight p.m. okay
yes
yes and
so if you want to shop i suggest you the first one in the museum and then go to funan later
the shops tend run a little bit later at about ten o'clock
uh huh
in the evening
no in the morning
in the morning
yes
so i can visit this place first and then while waiting for funan centre to open and then i can visit funan centre after that okay
yah that's right
so i have two destinations already
uh um do you have an idea like how many hours it would take me to tour the whole chinatown area to the centre
the museum itself
the museum itself if you're very interested about uh maximum one hour i think
an hour okay
hum
or forty five minutes
some people just rush through it because they're not interested
but if you really look at things an hour would be more than enough
yes
i see okay
so the first i'll be uh visiting this place first and then next stop is the funan centre
and i have uh some
i have a list of things to buy so i don't think and male shoppers just buy what they want right away
yes
you uh i suggest you go round the shops and check the prices and what accessories they give you
and then you can tell them honestly you're price checking so they give you good prices and then you can decide where to buy from
yes
i see okay
alright
so let's say i i'm done with funan centre but i didn't really like maybe you know uh the prices there
maybe i want the cheap because uh is there any other places i can visit like similar uh similar it malls
like that
uh it malls i think that's the one i know of because i shop there too
uh let me try
uh we have it fairs in singapore
if you like crowded shopping you should come during the fair time
uh huh
uh huh
and that time is when
okay just a minute huh
so we just had one
okay
oh the fair right
yes the fair
does it happen often or maybe just uh once a year or something
i think we have now about four times a year
i see
oh i love fairs most especially when it comes to things i'm interested in like gadgets and stuff
like that right
ah yah
so
i'm sorry
while you're looking for information we need uh in july what kind of weather can i expect in singapore
uh it can be very hot in singapore so bring very light clothing
hmm very light clothing
uh how about do you have an estimate on maybe the temperature itself like in farenheit or in centigrade
okay centigrade about thirty three degrees
wow that's hot
uh yah
on a good cool day uh if it rains maybe twenty eight twenty nine
but it will catch up to thirty two
ah okay
okay let's yah
let's talk about the temperature a little bit later
so yah
do you have any other alternative shops for me
okay
oh yah
let's say yah
you mentioned the fair sorry
okay
july no this one is electronic components
we have no these are trade shows
um hm trade show
no this is not it
not a good choice
it fairs open fair
i put in consumer
okay
i can see an expo there
events yes
but i'm not sure if those are electronic expos for consumers
okay
you can try comex i think
comex alright
comex
yes comex
a comex large exhibition hm
okay this is in september though
september okay
that's okay
well i'm pretty sure i can uh buy you know whatever i need uh in uh at funan centre so that's fine
but i'll
so what this one's over
uh huh
yah
this one uh if you have a look at this one comex is held at suntec city which is another convention centre but they turned the hall into a big shopping area
oh
uh wow
so maybe when there's no fair or expo going on uh you can expect uh lots of things that you can buy electronic stuff
uh no uh when they just there is a fair it is a specific fair
so if it'll be a furniture fair or a food fair or a
okay
okay
i see
oh so the at that place is not exclusive for electronic shows and things like
no uh let me do you want to get into here
alright
okay
um comex and it show okay
are you able to read it
yes it says comex and the it show
what gadgets did you
gadgets hm
get okay during the it show
alright
okay may i'll uh
but that is september right
is that right
yes it but um the show was held in september of last year though
um let's see
yah so usually it will be around that time
around that time
you see in march we just had an it show
oh so i missed it
yah i missed it hm
but we have four
i think september is one of the ones
i see okay yah
okay oh uh remember this kind of uh expo then the comex and the it show and i believe yah
it's uh available on facebook i can keep track of their uh their activities yes okay
so that's settled then hmm. so that
anything else you would like to buy in singapore or see
i love electronics but mainly what else
i have a question about the weather again though
okay
thirty three degrees uh celcius or centigrade uh can be hot but it's uh similar to uh what we experience here in my country during the summer season
that's what uh
yes that's right
uh that's not uh really a problem for me
uh so i have two destinations uh funan centre and possibly uh the convention centre where co the comex and it show are held
yah that's if it's on
yes
but there if there is no uh expo going on then it's gonna be uh like a mall right
uh yes there are shops there are lots of shops there you know to buy clothings uh fashion other items
and if
shops
mainly for clothing um hm
yah if you want buy uh let me go to if you want to buy cameras are you interested in cameras
oh my brother is so i think you know i can uh add to my shopping list uh maybe a few camera peripherals and attachments
yes
okay
peninsula shopping centre has many uh shops selling cameras
there are different shops
so again check out the prices there
uh i'm trying to get the shopping centre for you here
okay
uh huh okay
wait uh and it's also near to chinatown
you could walk or take a bus
two bus stops away
uh huh i'll take note of that yes
and uh if it's near chinatown i can it's near my hotel
uh sa it's near santa grand hotel yes
yah
yes
yes you see it's north bridge road
uh chinatown is in south bridge road area just separated by the river and you walk a little bit and you'll reach peninsula plaza
and you can also eat there and then you can walk to the shops but they haven't the camera shops haven't put themselves online
uh huh north bridge road
i see
right
i see okay
i love chinese food
okay when it comes to food do you have uh anything listed about filipino restaurants near the area
uh if you come in on a weekend and you want to meet filipinos and eat filipino food you go to what we called little filipino little philippines
uh it's actually lucky plaza
that's where all the filipinos congregate and so on the fourth and fifth floors uh we have what si shops serving just filipinos
lucky but it's not actually a place it's more of an event like it happens
it's no it's a shopping centre
a very old one down in orchard road which is the shopping area
are you getting it on your screen
yes i can see lucky plaza when the there's a map yes
and there are buses from chinatown to orchard road so if you come and you include a sunday on your visit on sunday you go up there and you'll see lots of filipinos you can get perhaps a better variety of filipino food because sunday is when well are assumed to be off work yes
i see
well sunday
oh i'll take note of that
sunday and is there a particular time or just during that the whole day
sunday
uh the whole day you can get lunch dinner there but you want to eat filipino food in singapore
eh yah
but yah
maybe you know if ever i get homesick just for the day. it's for
just for the day. it's for
uh i believe there's a stall at the airport also run by a filipino
oh yah
uh i can't remember at which it's actually at the place where uh the staff eat
it's a staff canteen but you can go there and i used to eat there filipino food
okay
uh huh
uh it's a trivia for me
alright
hm if i go if i'm including sunday in my travel list is i'll also go to church uh the christian church
is there a christian church nearby
uh which uh is it catholic or uh
just christian
christian
like it can be baptist but yah
not really catholic but christian i think there's a new life christian centre uh in singapore
new life christian centre yes
i heard of new life
wait huh
new life
is it called christian
i am not sure i'm sorry
yah christian centre or the biggest here in the philippines uh we do have that in several sites as well accross the country
okay
i put in singapore and i'll try and get you the address
that i okay
okay we have new life community church
i see
christian
can you recognise which one is affiliated to your church
hm it should be new life vineyard church
i'm not sure hm
oh
maybe you can check that the vineyard church one
yah
uh that is an interesting part of singapore also
you can do some tasting of chinese food
oh
uh there
and if i'm not mistaken there's also a filipino restaurant there uh because i was there recently and i passed it
ah okay
i see
hm is this a church now
brunch gathering okay yes it is christian
and does it is it uh nearby or do i have to travel by bus
uh no this one you need to take a bus uh because the trains don't go exactly there
but it's an interesting quarter of singapore
really
okay
then maybe uh there are lot of sights to see i guess
yes
yes um there are food especially to try
a blend of chinese and malay food and as i said there is a filipino uh like a café there
okay
yah okay
nearby
alright
sunday i got alright
this is new life vineyard church
so yah and it's at one eight three east coast road
church
alright got it
and uh how many minutes of uh travel by bus
do you think
uh huh let me see
number ten east west number thirty two
um you see the instructions at the bottom here
yes one eight three
uh with an arrow
uh huh
we're directly opposite the ocbc bank
op
yah i think allow yourself forty five minutes
oh so that's a bit too far i guess
that's good that's okay
oh by the way
but it's fun to go
it's interesting place
yes
i'll keep that in mind
i'm listing all of the uh places that i've asked about uh from the start of our conversation here okay hm. alright
forty five minutes so if this i've i missed the first service it's about thirty okay yah
let just a minute
let me get the what is the services
okay it's at eleven thirty a.m
uh huh okay
so i need to
i need to be on the bus at ten thirty i guess
yes to be safe
because on sundays it's off peak for public transport
to be safe
oh yah
how is the traffic in uh singapore on sundays
is it
uh the buses uh don't come as frequently as they do during uh office days and of peak hours
peak hours they send many more buses in the early mornings and in the evenings when people are going to work and coming back
i mean i have great
i see
so that is why you need to allow time
but then on the trains it's only about four minutes or five minutes off peak the most
usually
i see
usually about three minutes
three minutes
but uh does the traffic get pretty congested on sundays or not really
no
that's good
it's yah it's more relaxing on sundays
oh okay
so the forty five-minute travel time by bus is pretty much uh smooth ride without
yes smooth yah
traffic jams and things like that
okay
so the farthest place so far in my online list is the church
hmm okay new life vineyard church
you could go all the way north and visit the night safari if you want
the night
or
but what kind of place is that jeanne
uh it's a night zoo
ah okay
like all of it the nocturnal animals can be viewed there right
yes that's right
say what are your interest back in philippines
what do you like to do
hm i love mainly i love those geek stuff i mentioned earlier
i love geek stuff but i also like travelling
hm like i'm interested in beaches as well but not like you know my friends here they are very much uh into uh beaches and stuff like that
but is there a beach somewhere
beach just to swim right
it's uh
or hmm yes
to relax and you know enjoy the sun
i know it can get very hot in july right
uh sentosa siloso beach
okay i'm gonna get you a beach in sentosa island
and how far is that from my hotel do you think
from your hotel you could go by train and then i'll get to the train section a little bit later
okay
uh yah
i don't think uh you know my destinations can be uh visited in just one day
uh exactly
uh or
right
okay i can see the website from here
siloso beach
siloso is that um a singaporean term for something
uh we were told it's a filipino term for jealousy
is that right
yes it is
so it is correct huh
yes it is correct
uh i don't know ho
but is the owner filipino by any chance
uh no siloso is just the name of this stretch of the beach on sentosa
just a name
i see okay
and you could swim there
there are beach shelters
you can eat there you know uh there are bistros you could there are also like ice cream parlors
things like that
wow okay
and
and we have beach parties also sometimes
in siloso beach at siloso beach
yes siloso yes
or tanjong
there's another beach called tanjong beach
tanjong beach
uh on sentosa
uh sentosa island has attractions also but this is just the beach area i'm showing you
okay thank
that's right um hm
wait uh let's uh no uh let me see
okay
okay yah
they're both very good
uh huh okay
you see on the island they have free bus service to bring you so you could go to both beaches
uh the free buses is wonderful
okay
yah
and you can take let me get on the mrt for sentosa
okay
just a minute yah
okay
this is our mass rapid transit system
okay i can see the map right
so you come in here
are you following my mouse
see at changi airport
yah changi airport
yah and you can go all the way down here
it's the east-west line
east-west line
and you and you can connect down to uh raffles place
raffles place
or you can connect down to sorry
city hall
okay
and then you change to go to dhoby ghaut uh which is a major interchange and then you take another train you're down right into chinatown
i see
ah okay i got it
so chi huh so how about the travel duration
how many minutes would it take me from the beach to the chinatown
beach to chinatown okay
sentosa island is here
can you see harbourfront
yes i can see harbourfront
so from chinatown you just take a train to harbourfront
oh i guess uh the travel time is pretty quick
yes uh
not really a big deal
including walking up and down the steps and everything maybe twenty minutes
the ride itself would be maybe five minutes you know
two and a half minutes very short
and then here you take a shuttle into sentosa which is at the bus station within walking distance
you walk about five minutes and where the public buses stop you can take a sentosa bus in for one dollar
five minutes
i see
ah okay
uh huh okay
you know what i'm curious
i've never been to singapore and thank you for giving me all these wonderful travel destinations
i'm just curious cause i've never been there
uh the navigation is it easy like i can just read bulletin boards and street signs in english are
is it easy like i can just read bulletin boards and street signs in english are all of them are in english right
um hmm
yes uh the bus stops have the entire route for not the entire route but the route of the buses where they're going to go
you just if you're taking a public bus you just need to be on the correct side of the road so you can ask anybody at the bus stop
they'll be able to tell you
bus stop
and uh when you are at the airport go down to the mrt station and buy a card
uh you need to pay a small deposit
i think it's about ten dollars or seven dollars which you get back uh when you go back home
and maybe there's a small charge for making the card you know just a nominal fee
but the deposit you put extra deposit is for your travel fare so you don't have to worry about carrying the correct amount of money
okay
okay
wow
ah okay i see
and i'm pretty sure uh is it safe to assume that my lo my credit card will be accepted in most of the merchants or shops there in singapore
uh yes
at the it shops uh i think they would accept
at the major stores they would accept yes
if you pay it on the streets in chinatown if you buy souvenir say three souvenirs for ten dollars then they would not accept
uh i need cash yes
yah you need some cash
you might want to change it when you arrive at the airport
the rates are quite decent
right okay
so that if you are staying just two days there's no point hunting for a money changer who usually gives a slightly better rate
and yah
thanks
and the i can do money changing at the airport
is it
yes
possible there
okay
yes you can change at the airport and then go to the basement where the mrts which stands for mass rapid transit
uh get your travel card
so once you've got your local money you can buy your travel card and they will supply you a map
at least they used to a map and they can both also be very informative
uh huh
i see
ah okay
about how to travel you know if you're not sure there they will give you very good directions
alright
now i think i have a few more questions. i have asked for the funan centre the museum the beach
now i think i have a few more questions. i have asked for the funan centre the museum the beach
any uh do you have any recommendations on uh like natural scenic spots in singapore like that know things like that
nature-related
nature-re uh related
one of my best uh places is this place and you should bring your binoculars if you're going
uh huh okay
i think uh that here
pertains to the map
nature
but there are also places that you can just do a walk
uh this one you have to travel because it's in the north and you are in the south of singapore
ooh
it's gonna be pretty far i believe
so is it sungei buloh wetlands museum
yes sungei buloh
it means bamboo river
sungei is a bamboo and buloh
no sungei is a river and buloh is river
uh huh
uh sorry
buloh is bamboo and so river bamboo
oh
buloh river uh i get it
and it's a wetland reserve
yah
if you go at low tide or even high tide you can see mudskipper uh you can see a uh tree climbing crabs
if you come in december you can see migratory birds
uh huh migratory birds sorry
uh that fly from um uh as far away as mongolia and some continue to perth
now let me see
you can take a train up to kranji
kranji is where it's located
uh huh okay
and then you take this bus called the kranji express
can you see this
kranji
yes i can see a timetable
a schedule
yah
so at the kranji when you get out of the train you come out on the road you wait for this bus and you pay him three dollars for a two-way transfer
he'll give you a ticket
uh huh two-way transport
so yah
so when you're at sungei buloh check out the times that they leave sungei buloh back to the station so you can time yourself on your walk
kranji
uh huh
okay i got that
thanks
so i have nick uh sungei how do you pronounce that sungei
buloh sungei buloh
sungei buloh
wet wetland reserve
then or you can continue on the bus and just visit other places
this is just some of them that he will drop you
uh it's a gardenasia
i think it's a nursery
okay
uh bollywood is also nursery
hay dairies they have got goats from all over the world
uh and the like the whole place this uh sungei buloh wetland reserve is it like an open space or like wildness
yes
okay it is
that's nice
uh if you want to watch migratory birds in december then oh anyway from september to march then you need like half a day or one day there
uh because i need to wait for the birds to mi to do the migrating thing right
i guess
no uh they will be there but the thing is you might enjoy it and walk around and there are trails over the uh marine life and trails over uh ponds uh in there
so if you're a birder a twitter they may normally spend half a day there
i see
alright
but if you just want to see then you can continue on the bus and visit the rest of the places
uh huh okay
wow wonderful
so i have lots of destinations
i already have lots of destinations here listed
uh my favourite would be of course uh funan centre and uh maybe the beach yes
i'm gonna i have to check that out
alright
any other recommendations
uh we have attractions uh if you want like the bird park
the bird park
yes
bird park
bird
we have the jurong bird park
if you are lazy to uh look at birds you know through your binoculars you want them in your face
okay
jurong bird park
i don't think i would love birds on my face though but it's okay
and you can see them there you can have them flying right in front of you
like very close to me
okay
this one's nice
well i've always been uh fascinated with birds uh fascinated by the you know wildlife right
yah
so this one is nice
so uh this one is not so wild because it's an attraction but sungei buloh is wild
it's re
oh yah
okay
let me take note of that
there you go
alright
very nice
alright
if you want more information on wild places uh you when you come in to singapore you might want to contact someone from uh nature society and we have nature guides there
so
or they
i see
they are the more hardcore people you know
the more what do you call them
hardcore
you want to
ah sorry
really wild uh
lord heart
like an organisation right
uh it's a yes but there are guides in there that can help you
i see
or like you can see horseshoe crab
so just remember this uh website when you come and see
and there are public walks that you can join
public walks huh
oh i can see the website
it's a nature society right
yah
yes
very nice
so the this is focused on wilderness whereas places like the zoo and the bird park is more attractive you know for tourists who don't want to get too muddy or dirty or
okay
of um
alright
well for uh any other tips when i'm while i'm in singapore like um are there any uh how do i say this
hm guidelines things that i should not do on the streets you know
things like
uh you should walk uh at traffic light junctions and you know you should walk carefully
don't jaywalk
okay
uh it's actually for your own safety because the traffic can be you know uh they follow traffic rules but people are used to people not walking when the lights are red so you should just follow the rules there
uh not to litter
i see
yah
oh okay not to litter
yes
uh yah you can bring in gum to chew if you need to chew gum but just don't bring in great quantities because you're not allowed to import chewing gum
ooh
ah really
uh you can chew it but you can't import it because if you stick the gum in the wrong place you can stop the trains from moving
you know what i mean
okay i get it
uh huh
that's why we have the rule because uh if there's no total contact the doors don't shut properly the trains get stuck
ooh yes
so we can't afford to have people chewing gum
i see
also dirtying the place
yah
is it okay to like you know use my camera and just take pictures of people and you know random places or is there a regulation some kind of regulation about my camera use
if you're in a place of worship uh it's better not to photograph people
uh and maybe you want to ask the temple people before you do the photographing
if you're photographing the architecture like the statues uh the facade that's
worship places of worship okay
place of worship
yes
quite alright
yah that's
that's okay
that's okay
and in the airport i don't think they want you to use your camera
yes i don't think so too
alright
i'm just curious about since you mentioned temple what is the uh common religion in singapore
we have all religions in singapore uh but um as the majority three quarters of us are chinese
the buddhism and taoism is very uh visible in singapore
in fact within walking distance of your hotel there is a fairly new buddhist temple and it's huge
oh yah
at the what that's something that i would like to visit the temples
any nearby temples
uh i propose you visit another one that is further away
uh you can walk too but it's not so near as this new temple
maybe the oldest temple
yes
i love old buildings
that's uh this one
okay here it is
telok ayer street is just one street away from where you are
oh it's very near
quite near right
wow i love that infrastructure right there
what do you call that building
how do you like uh
it's thian hock keng
uh huh
but is there a like uh a more common noun name for it
uh that's what we call it
unfortunately the street name is also this name is chinese dialect
the street name is telok ayer street which is
telok ayer street
yah which is water bay street
can you see here
it means water bay street
uh huh
oh oldest most singaporean tem i can see like a temple over the temple overview yes
yes
and uh if you go there you allow some time to visit uh mosque hm two doors away from it
it's just been newly renovated again but it's about as old as this temple
i see
this temple actually dates from the eighteen twenties when it was a little shrine
so it's one of the oldest in singapore
and uh are there monks there now
i mean you know like i get to see them
uh no i'm afraid it's a bit more like a tourist attraction except on feast days
oh okay
uh the one way you get to see a lot of monks is the one very near uh buddha tooth relic
buddha tooth relic
this is also a good
buddha tooth relic
this one is strictly buddhist
strictly yes
buddha tooth relic uh
yah
thian hock keng is a buddhist and taoist so you get a lot of other deities that are common to both religions but here you get mostly buddha
and they cannot but
this is south bridge road
yes sorry
right
i i'm sorry but i cannot take pictures of those deities right
no
uh i think you ask whoever looks like a monk in there first before you take the photograph
i see
yah so as not to offend them it would be a bit better
oh
i see
but also what you're trying to say is that there's a chance that they would allow you to do that or
yes they might if you look very obviously like a tourist
you know is it i hope i would look like a very much like a tourist to them when i visit there
okay
so they would allow
can i show you the these photos here
yes okay
okay
there it is
wow
so this is grander looking
it's new uh you see
so this is the most recent photograph of this building is it
yes
this one is just a few years old but the other one it has been restored but uh the last time i went about a month ago they are still restoring parts of it so maybe the back you can't go
okay
and uh yes
this is the buddha tooth relic
and you can go inside this building or maybe
yes you can go inside
uh make sure you use the side door
the there are doors in the centre and doors to the left and right of the centre
use the side doors
just side doors
yah the main door is for the temple priest to go in
i see
oh
there's there's another one
uh that is this one is also in chinatown and it's a heritage temple
right
and do these temples or you know tourist temple attractions uh ask for entrance fees and uh things like that
do they ask you for you know like a ticket
okay
no
regular museum does
no okay
no but
so that is for free
no uh but here the tem uh the sri mariamman if you use your camera inside they'll ask you for a camera fees
just a few dollars
wow
ah okay
wow this eh are those uh statues of people
here they are
wow
the those are statues so it's very spectacular for uh photography
yah
very colourful uh
it's very interesting
wow
it's hindu
this is hindu
you see this picture here
i love that
yes i can see the pictures
hindu
and this is very uh this is has a very authentic view because people are still uh praying here they're worshiping here so you should go in the morning before twelve
oh
morning before twelve
why
yes
they close from about twelve to about four four thirty
they have a short break and then they re-open in the evening
so either that or you go in the evening
ooh
so before twelve they should come to this place bef
yes if you want to use your camera you get better light also
i see
and they're closed between twelve and four
uh they have a small door open you can get in but inside there's no activity there's nobody praying you know it's the temple priests are not around
i see
okay wow
so this is another destination for me
the temples are very interesting and they're very uh perfect for you know uh camera enthusiasts and photos and things like
yah
right
okay very nice
right
okay
okay
oh i see i have well you
anything else
well um i think uh that would be all
you've been very helpful and informative
i've learnt a lot about you know different things and i'm pretty sure there are a lot of other places to visit uh given the chance
but uh as for now i think uh okay
i'm losing you

and i presume you are in your twenthies you sound young
yes i am twenty five and i lo
okay
and your friend is
yah uh twenty six
i'm planning to travel with just a backpack
oh just a backpack
okay
yes
yes
okay
can you give me some uh tell me some cheap rate hotels because i'm planning just to leave my bags there and go somewhere take some pictures
okay
and eh what are your interest
uh my interest
uh photography
uh for sure i'll bring my camera and other stuff
but uh may uh i i like taking pictures
okay
you would do you have a particular subject
is it people or you also take sceenery and animals
scenery
nature
ye uh nature like plant scenery
yah scenery
okay scenery
uh people also
uh yah
culture
like
culture
i like culture
architecture
yah uh i can also take those pictures
but i like cultu uh nature more
like buildings
nature okay
uh how about animals
yah
animals
yah
okay
i'm going to recommend firstly you want to have a backpack type of hotel right
yes
i'm just gonna bring my backpack and my buddy with me
so i'm kinda looking for a hotel that is not that expensive
just gonna leave our things there and you know stay out the whole day
okay
let me get you
so you don't mind if it's a bit uh not so roomy like hotel because you just back to sleep
yes
yes
as we just gonna put our things there and then go out to take some pictures
okay um
let's try this one okay
okay
is the inncrowd backpackers hostel in singapore
but uh you are looking for a room right
you are not looking for a bed
uh a bed
is there a bed there
just a bed
yah we do have backpackers joints were you get uh only a bed if you like include six to eight people in a room
so there are different categories
a bed
oh great
that sounds nice
because uh i'm just thinking of a place where i can you know leave my bags my stuff you know
and when i come back i just sleep for just a few hours and then go out at night with my friend
and then you save a lot of money huh
yes
i was i'm planning to save lots of money or much money just to spend there for like a souvenir or taste singaporean food like that

that's right eating
yes i love eating
you'll have a heaven here for eating
you can eat a lot of food a lot of um
yes
yes
actually i'm an adventurous person
uh i eat different kinds of foods
uh so you could eat street food
yah
i'd like to try it
singaporean street food
okay
so i'm thinking of a place where i can uh just walk and then um get some street food or yah i'm planning to be immersed in singapore but to stay in hotel
okay
okay this is very colourful for you two guys
uh this is in little india
and uh can you see the rates on your screen
uh yes
if you take a dorm bed per person only twenty dollars
if you take a room it's two single beds at fifty nine dollars
and that would be fifty nine for two beds
wow that's good
tak okay
that sounds go
yah the prices are based on per person per bed or dorm
but this one is room
so it should be fifty nine for the two room
so you're actually paying about ten dollars more per person only
oh okay
that's the price is reasonable actually
it's good
is it near at train station or something like a public transportation station
yes
little india has got two tran stations two stops
they are actually quite close to each other
that's little india stop and the farrer park stop
and your hotel would be in that vicinity
so you see you get here you get breakfast dinner
that means you get your towel you got a locker and internet access
okay
okay is it
wow
okay
and that's for a fifty nine singaporean dollar
yes
if you take a bit more luxurious a double room a double bed and a single bed
that means one of you sleeps in a bigger bed
it's that's fifty nine dollars
that would be for three people i think
okay
yah
okay
great
that sounds great
so uh is it near the airport
uh no but you can get there easily by taking the trains uh from the airport
you just need to make a change in the train direction
if you went for example all the way to chinatown so you will have to cha take a change of trains
ah okay
because i have no idea at all about singapore trains or transit
uh how can i go to the train or to the transit from the airport
is it just outside the airport
okay i'm yes
uh it's actually at the basement the airport
and that is the first thing you should do when you arrive
uh change some local money and then uh you take the train
uh you buy the card first
you buy the card and ah you pay a deposit
you put money into the card then after that you don't have to worry about having enough change to uh pay the fare
a card
yes card okay
okay
oh uh so it means that i can use that card any day
yes you can use the card uh
as lo as lo yes as long as it has a credit right
that's right
as long as you got money in it uh you will get a card
okay
so it's not a problem
okay
and uh um waiting for it to download the map
let me see
okay it's coming on now
good
okay
then i can show you uh the location of your hotel and in relation to where the airport is
okay if you look on the right-hand side of the sccren can you see changi airport at the bottom right-hand where number three is
yes please
yes
yes i can see it
changi airport
so chang that is right
okay
so when you reach the airport you go down to the basement
uh this would be the airport terminals conduc connecting terminals one two and three
if you are at a budget hotel uh budget airport you have to take a shuttle to the main airport and then go to the bus stat to the um train station and
okay
uh is it far from the airport or i tak or i can just walk to the a
no it's between the airport but it's easier to just take the shuttle
it's a free shuttle that runs bet
oh
yah
so you get your ticket you pay your deposit
and i think at the airport they gave you a map
and to give you an idea
so all this is free
and then you travel along the east line towards the west
can you see tanah merah on the second stop
okay
okay a map
hm tanah merah yes
okay
so that is where you change to go down to town to the west towards the west
and you go down to just give me a minute
to uh i think the easiest way is to go to outram park
can you see where it goes all the way down and it curves up a little bit
outrum park
yah
quantrum park is that
yes
o u r t o u t r
ah outra okay outram park
yes
alright
so when you get up there you take the line towards little india
so it's one two three stops and you are at little india
hm okay
so this is the place that you can go out and try street food you can soak in the atmosphere
you would love taking your camera out because you can photograph the indian garland makers the fortune tellers
uh it's full of life and culture
it's one of my favourite places
oh
oh great
oh yah
is little india is like a indian community town or indiantown
yes
so there are hindu temples there
you can photograph beautiful architecture and statues of the different deities the hindu deities
okay
great
so other than indiantowns are there other uh nations town there or race town
other than chinatown and indiatown
what else
okay
yes
okay little india if you are visiting the temples you avoid from about twelve noon to four o'clock they have a break
so you go early morning or you go in the evening
and then chinatown you take the same line
can you see chinatown
two three stops down
so you'll get off at chinatown you are right in the heart of chinatown
and in chinatown we have uh also bhuddist temple and terrace temple also great for photography
yes
yes okay
okay great
so we have little india then chinatown other than that two there are other kinds of town right
like uh is there a um something like vietnamese town or just the two of these
not vietnamese but there is uh kampong glam which you have to go by bus because well actually you could go by train because you are young and healthy you can walk
uh go
yah i like walking
you go to um city hall station
so let's say you are at little india you gotta run to dhoby ghaut
can you see dhoby ghaut
uh dhoby ghaut yes
yah just one stop uh towards the south
and then you take the red line which is called the circle line and you get just one stop at city hall station
and when you get off ask the direction to beach road
so not only do you walk towards the malay quarter or rather the historic uh quarter for the malays the malays have mainly moved out from there
but there's a beautiful mosque there and on the way you will pass raffles hotel which is a historic hotel and also a consolation buidling
hm okay
ah okay
okay great
what about at night
uh what other activities can we do with my friend during the night
uh do you like barhopping uh or just you still want to walk around stroll around and take in the sights
uh maybe after barhopping may be we can just stroll around
oh wait i have a question
is it safe there to walk just walk around at night
uh you can yes very safe
um you don't just flash go chains around your neck you'll be okay
it's quite safe
i understand
yah
is there a like curfew in singapore
no curfew
we haven't heard of one for a long time
um most singaporean's will not know what you mean when you say curfew
ah okay
so it wouldn't matter if we just stroll around at three o'clock in the morning something like that
yah no problem
uh no problem at all
so if you take your train like little india you would take the train to dhoby ghaut you take the circle line down and you go down to marina bay
that's a very scenic area by the river and you could walk around there and you if you want the bus you go down to clarke quay
just clarke quay there
and we it's not shown on the map but we have a river there and you could go barhopping you could eat you could pick-up some girls
oh great
oh yes i see that
okay
yah
no i'm not intested
okay
ah okay
but you meet a lot of people there that you know they will might just talk to you if they are tourists
yah i yah i like making friends specially with other yah other people or in strange place uh like singapore
okay because um i have a friend who just go to other countries uh just having his backpack and then just leave his things in a room or in a hotel and roam around take pictures
i'm gonna thinking to do the same thing
yes
yah that is really good
uh another place say okay the next day i or if you want to go to attractions to take photos ah of animals you i suggest you go through the uh wildlife safari's park uh which you can also reach by train and by bus
yes
uh wait i have a question
on that weekend will there be an occasion special occasion that's going to happen in singapore where i can go and take some pictures
yah
uh it's more it's also easter for the catholics and the christians in singapore
so you might want to go to midnight mass
uh i don't know whether the priest will be happy if you are using your flash taking photos
but uh in the day the churches are very beautiful to photograph
they are not decorated but uh you will be able to photograph them
yah
okay
yah actually it's quite nice
what about in uh outside the city
there is some place to go out from the city where i can take pictures
yes so uh there are two places i want to suggest to you one is the natural wildlife area
it's called sungei buloh wetland reserve and there you can capture birds and crabs uh monitor lizards crabs climbing trees
and got uh yes
it's all natural
so once i bought a friend and he caughts a got a photograph of a monitor lizard eating a fish
so it's trail fo
okay
i'll take note of that
um crabs
ah really
oh so they are all wild animals
yes they are all wild and they are protected there
so for bird photography is very good
uh and if you are really into bird photography it's from about september to april
actually if you come now right away you can still catch some brids uh that are coming from mongolia
so you know they are migratory birds

is it far from my hotel
how long would it take to go there from my hotel
okay from your hotel i don't have the map now but you connect with the uh northbound line
sorry the westbound line and you go all the way to kranji and then you take a bus
uh you see the kranji express here
you pay three dollars as an adult and you get a ticket which you can use for your return journey
oh
so

so approximately how long would it take to travel
because i don't want to spend day on travelling or uh riding bus or riding trains
how long would it take
from you hotel to here may be about 50 minutes or so f you plan it correctly
so you look at the train timing
uh you see the first line kranji
that's when the bus arrives to pick-up people
so if you miss the nine o'clock the next one is ten-fifteen
but the alternative is if you miss this you take the public bus and then you have to walk about half a kilometre from where the bus stops to the reserve
if you take this bus it drops you right outside
yes
ah oka
oh okay
oh okay
does it have an entrance fee
uh entrance free at the moment is free
oh so it's free
some day as they charge one dollar
i might be wrong on that it's no more than one dollar anyway which is nothing you know
it's uh not even one u.s. it's one singapore
and you see the rest of stops on the kranji express
uh they've got a dairy farm where they have goats producing goats milk
uh and uh yes
so if you catch the bus on it's whole journey you get to visit the other farms
but i think sungei buloh itself is enough to interest you
uh huh okay
ah yes
uh wo
so if i go there and arrive uh let say uh in the evening and then maybe take some rest and then in the morning what do you suggest to go first
where do you
you need to come here in the morning because they close about six o'clock seven o'clock
it will be too late to see anything
uh okay
so that's the first place that i should go to first thing in the morning
okay
yes
that is right
so um you could time yourself so that when you come out of here you could go to the bird park so that if no birds waive at you at this park you go to the bird park and they all be smiling at you
okay
great
so bird park i like bird park
okay
let me try and get it for you here
jurong is the place it is at and it's also well not too far from here so it's convenient to go
b i r d p a r k okay
i'm getting some noise at your sector
ah okay
oh
oh yah
i don't know what's that
but it's outside the room
you can hear it
can you hear it
oh it's ou yes i can hear it
it sounds like an airplan flying by.
it sounds like an airplan flying by.
okay so here we have got bird shows you'll be very good at taking photographs here
birds are there
uh this aviary can you see it on your screen
yes african waterfall aviary
yes the birds are flying free african
really
yes so
nice
okay well test your skill as a photographer
yah i would
uh actually it's interesting
and we also have a show uh two shows in fact
uh during showtime they offer you to hold a falcon and you can photograph your friend and he can photograph you
yah alright
and at the sho
other than birds what other animals can we take a picture
so this is the bird park but okay i'm going to see uh ticketing alright
because i'm suggesting that you buy a package ticket so that you can get okay so you see it's open from eighty-thirty till six
and can you see this
the one that's uh a bit darker in colour
that is a package
it's called a park hopper special
oh
ah okay park hopper special okay
for adults it's fifty eight singaporean dollar
yah you see three parks
you see the zoo
the night safari
which i suggest on the same day so that you can just walk from the zoo and the night safari is next door
and then the bird park you go uh on the day you go sungei buloh because you can take the train connection from kranji you would just go southwards and you are at jurong and you just take a bus and you are there
dol yah
oh
oh okay great
great
i'm planning to go there
ah nice uh okay
so what about other than street food of course i have to eat my dinner
wha where do you suggest me to eat my dinner
the day that you are going to the night safari and zoo i suggest you eat at the night safari or zoo
we have some restaurants there
uh they have something cute called the bongo burger
hm the bongo burger
is that a singaporean burger
no the bongo is one of the names of the animals there
but it's not
i heard it's a special singaporean food
no it's not
they just used the name of the animal
um at the bird park too they have a restaurant
so that would make it much easier
you would save time
okay
yah because i also want to experience singaporean delicacies or singaporean dishes
uh sing do you like hot food
do you like curries
curries
yah
indian curries
yah i like indian curries
what about singaporean
do they taste the same
uh the curries that you get in the place where you know in little india they are authentic indian taste
but if you tell them that you don't want so much chili or you know to tell you which one is very hot then they can tell you and you can avoid ordering those uh dishes
uh but west coast road we have restaurants that serve north and south indian restaurants
uh south indian food
both north and south
ah okay
what about singaporean restaurants
like they you know they offer singaporean delicacies or singaporean dishes
do you have a singaporean dishes in singapore
uh singaporean food is mostly try at the uh food courts
uh so it is not uh what do you call it
fine dining
but it's where you can actually see everybody cooking and uh in fact ask the person what is he doing whether they were be very nice to happy to accomodate you
and then you can at the one place you can try chinese malay and in uh mostly chinese food
these's one i am recommending to you
it's at old market
let me get it on the website
it's maxwell road food centre
road food centre
so it is at place called maxwell road which is in chinatown
so if you take the train to chinatown from where you are and you'd it's near
you just walk there
so here you have a picture of the food centre
can you see the stalls on both sides
yah it's just near right
yes
so all this different coloured signs are different stalls
and if you like you if you go at different times you get different kinds of food or rather somes stalls if they are shut they are operating later or earlier
hm hm nice
okay nice
is it okay to take pictures on public in public places
yes it's okay
here it's okay
it's only at the places of uh worship that you have to be a bit more careful
and maybe ask for permission
but the
in what kind of places
like in a hindu temple or at a bhuddist temple
uh you know the people who are praying would not like to photographed
yah i understand
but what about in government offices like or government buildings uh i don't know may be some policemen might
uh at the airport uh discourages uh photographs
so you don't take photographs inside the airport
hm so ou but outside the airport it's okay
outsie the airport if you are taking yourselves standing at the gate i don't think anybody will make any noise
it's just when you are inside there
i think all airports are about the same now
okay
okay good

well there are many hotels uh that are very uh moderately priced
uh in the chinatown area
and near to the island there are other business class hotels like a hundred over dollars
but if you want to save the money on to spend time on sho uh spend the money on shopping and other things then we have the three-star hotels
but oh is it okay
oh is it nice too even if it's only three storey
even only it's a three-star hotel
uh the space is small within the rooms because most of the them are in conservation shophouses
ah okay
so anyway is it near right transportation and also is it near like convenience store wherein we can go to
ye yes very near
yes very near
okay
uh convenience stores and shops and food and you can walk around and soak in the atmosphere
so the location is very good right
yes
okay how about
and they're also clean and they are you know
it's just that you don't have a lot of space in there
you don't have the luxury of the five-star
yes just your uh bed maybe or a dresser and a restroom that's it right
yes that's right
uh usually they wi-fi air-conditioning
oh okay
and maybe a television and air-conditioning too
okay by the way jeanne okay what clothes should i bring if i visit your country

oh
off and on
so it can also rain right
yes
so that's why i
in april right
in april yes it may rain
uh now if you want to bring a cardigan just for the air-conditioned areas
okay
uh the it's more the air-conditioning chilling up the place than the real cold
okay
okay that's wonderful

it's one dollar to twenty two si sgd right
yes that's right
so you know this is a very high price uh hotel at five hundred

um so if you want yah
if you want to look at the hotels let me do hotels first then i will come to the other attractions
okay please do
and shopping
thanks for your help
thank you
i really appreciate you helping me right go through like places we can go to your beautiful country singapore
okay
why is your country called the lion city
why lion city
when the a prince came to singapore long ago he saw an animal
and he was told that far away there is an animal called a singa which is lion
oh singa
do you call a lion in singapore singa
is it called singa
actually singa
that's how that's why it's singapore you see
but actually we don't have lions naturally found here
oh okay
uh we have tigers or we once had tigers here in the jungle but not lions
so he could have seen a tiger
okay
he could have seen a wild boar and he was given the wrong information
so singapore was called the lion city right
yah that's right
okay that's wonderful
oh we've stuck with that name
okay now i know
uh maybe it's confusing for people who know their natural history right
i know
how about your culture
can you tell me something about your culture
i mean people in singapore how are they
uh we're multi-cultural
okay
uh different uh races here
chinese being the majority
and then we have malays and indians
and we also have uh eurasians europeans uh large expatriate of communities
so it's very easy to visit singapore
you can get all kinds of food
um and we are also very easy to move around i mean accessibility by train by uh
oh i see
oh okay train
okay
how about if i take a cab
would it cost me a lot of money if i do that
if you compare with europe it's much cheaper
but it's so much easier and uh convenient to go by train and by bus
oh so you have a train okay
so that will be easier right
it's a
and cheaper too
so um yes that's right
uh okay wait
i got the wrong hotels here
i put chinatown hotels and i got an american chinatown hotel
okay
let me do it again
so which do you recommended recommend
just a minute
okay
can you tell me something about your history maybe
we were uh but archaeological diggings have found that chinese have been coming here
the arabs as well to trade
so and that dates back long ago
but uh in 1819 that's the most recent history a british official in the far east came here and he brought along free trade
okay
he allowed people of different races to settle here to trade here
and he didn't charge taxes and that's why we became very popular with the people settling here and still today
okay
okay um
okay
ha i heard singapore is a very safe city
so there is no
yes it is
the crime rate is i think zero to one percent
am i correct
i don't know the official crime rate but what i know is that you just need to be careful with your belongings and not be a bit careless so that you know people don't just help themselves your things
okay so
okay so okay
that's wonderful
how about your language what
how about your language what what languages do you write speak in singapore
is it uh predominantly mandarin hokkien or cantonese
english it's more english
oh english alright
so
or something that we call singlish which is a mixture of english with the chinese grammar
oh and oh really can you tell me how it works
oh really can you tell me how it works
uh why you so like that
that is
oh that's singlish
oh okay
it's singlish
uh that's similar why are you behaving this way
in a friendly manner you know
okay
so it's a you can probably make it out
uh it's fun too
um m hotel
okay i have got some hotels here for you
oh
okay oh i
okay oh i
if you're interested in the island m hotel is
and how how much would it cost me if i stay in m hotel singapore

can you see it on your screen
yes
it's hundred and sixty two dollars
okay
so compared to five twenty eight right
the first one you right
yes that's right
yah
alright
the first one
okay i think i'll consider staying in m hotel singapore because it's i mean cheaper
it's and you can take it up from there uh
it's suite side uh island uh and take the shuttle bus into uh sentosa
sentosa so so where is it located
so it's convenient
uh let me get the map of singapore for you

yes i can
okay that's fine
okay what i can see on my screen is resorts world sentosa
you have universal studios right
yes
that's what is on my screen
okay good
i'm gonna get the map for the mass rapid transit
okay
so that you can relate to where your hotel is
okay
and where the island that you'd like to visit sentosa where it is located
okay
so mrt line it's your train right
yes
yes mass rapid transit
okay mass rapid transit
okay mass rapid transit
so how much is the fare when i take ride mrt
i'll get that on the screen in a moment just let me show you the location first
okay
okay
so if you look down can you see a purple line that goes from uh the south of the island to the north
oh yes
uh hm yes i can see it
can you see ha you can see harbourfront
yes i can see it on my screen
right there yes
yes
so just opposite harbourfront it's the island of
harbourfront
yes
yes
just opposite it is the island of sentosa
oh i see
okay
and m hotel is do you see tanjong pagar on the green line just nearby
yes
right
that is where the m hotel is
okay and where is universal studio at
okay and where is universal studio at
it will be at sentosa island
sentosa island
okay
how about the district
shopping district
if i stay in
so shopping uh
yes if i stay and check in m hotel would it be easy for me to go to a lot of places where i can shop
uh not so at m hotel because it is nearer the business district
but if you check into orchard road that is where the high end shops are
yes i've heard about it
yes
uh can you see the red the
yes orchard road yes the red
yes orchard road yes the red right
red line yes
red line
do you see it
near to number eight
uh if you want to go and stay in chinatown we have uh little boutique hotels in chinatown
okay
and they're also the cheaper hotels which are all the hotels there are usually not so spacious because most of them occupy uh conservation buildings
oh yes
that's much shophouses
they join them up like 6 or 8 and they make a hotel
okay
but they're very decent inside. they're
but they're very decent inside. they're clean
okay
i mean i have friends in singapore and they were telling me there were like there are hotels that are cheaply priced in about twenty dollars or i think one hundred dollars a day
yes
do you know where
twenty dollars uh budget yah
twenty dollars probably you'll get a bed
okay just a bed
okay
i think you'll get a bed
uh hm uh you if you're interested we get the hostels for you
let's see from the website how they are like
so hostel right
okay let's go for check it out
i mean all you do is just sleep right
you might as well so you know get something cheap and just spend your money going out or maybe eating out or maybe shopping right
yes that's right
that's right
so uh well this one is good hangout hotels
uh can you see it
yes
it's not really bad
it's a shall i say it's a good one i think
is that a backpacker hotel right
is it a backpacker hostel right
it's a hostel but it's a good class hostel
okay
i also like the name hangout
hangout yes
just a minute
we're trying to get it to come on
uh so it's uh up-market backpacker
okay
let's go check it out
maybe you know i will you know rather stay in hangout hostel
uh the location is not bad
the location is at upper wilkie road which is within walking distance to an mrt station called dhoby ghaut
no
um hm
where we also have uh very good um uh train connections if you want to go elsewhere
okay
so if i stay in hangout hostel where what places can i go to
you can shop at dhoby ghaut which is within walking distance
oh so i can go there by foot right
by foot yes it's within walking distance and
by foot yes it's within walking distance and if you head at that-the other direction you will be in little india which is very full of heritage and culture and history which i believe you mentioned earlier
okay
oh
and a lot of food maybe
yes food
food are all over the place
in singapore you can get food anywhere anytime
uh let me get the room rates for you
okay
so you have a picture of the room
the bed
yes it looks nice
oh dear
they listed the budget but the room rate is two hundred and eighty five
and eighty five net
yes net
sounds good
uh but that's really not a backpacker rate
i know
that's even more expensive than the other hotel with in cost one hundred sixty eight dollars
so this one is
yes that's right
right more expensive
uh let me okay
alright here we go
oh cheap
okay
this is another website
okay
so you can have a private room
okay
twenty dollars and hm maybe this is the place where you know my friends were telling me about because it is surprisingly alright it's very cheap
a hundred and twenty
hm yes
so i'm assuming you want a room because if you go dormitory you see what i mean
twenty dollars is at dormitory
yes uh hm
a twin room will be okay i guess
yah
just now i found for other people even cheaper rooms in chinatown but i think this is also fine
looks good to me
i mean but if you know if you are travelling more than six people then this will be good
but for i guess i would settle for m hotel because it is like twin room right
uh hm that's right
uh i'm guessing but i think the room may be a little bit bigger
well okay
this is advisable for a group right
package or a group tour
okay
uh hm yes
uh this hotel the one footprints that we are looking at now it's in the little india area
perak road is it perak road
so yes
perak road perak is actually a place in malaysia
uh and this area here is right in the heart of little india
so if you like indian culture uh this is the place to stay
but if your preference is for more business class hotel and hotel with
little in okay
what can i see if i go to little india
what can i see if i go there and try to check it out
what can i see
you if you go there early in the morning let's say about nine o'clock or eight thirty. you can see people marketing
uh shops
you can see flower garland weavers making fresh flower garlands
and you can try the indian food
uh lots of vegetarian shops there
oh like a flea market right
uh well we don't call it a flea market just individual shops and the prices are very low
and very low
okay
so
uh they are reasonable should i say
and then you can go into the hindu temples
they are very colourful
okay
and where is it located at
the hindu temple
where is it at
can i see it
and okay
are you still on the same map
can you see the map of footprints
can you see serangoon road
yes
to the left perak road
so these little lanes are very short
and if you turn to the left there walk along serangoon road there are about three four hindu temples
okay
oh okay
and if you walk to the back of it there is a buddhist temple
uh two temples there's also a church there
so uh if you're into heritage this is really the place to be in
it's full of life morning noon and night
okay
so what other places should we visit while we're in singapore
what other places should we go to
the other place for culture would be chinatown
how about for adventure
because i'm bringing along my nephew maybe he would like to try i mean little like um what do you call extreme sport maybe
maybe uh bungee jumping
what else huh
uh bungee jumping i don't think we have unless it's purposely organised
uh we have do you know flying fox
hm yes i've heard of it
yes
we have activities like that
you know singapore we want to be a little bit safe
okay
and bungee jumping you also need some high cliffs or something right
to
okay
uh jump off
how about a zip-line ride
do you have zip-line rides in singapore wherein you know we can you know visit it
so yes
uh let me try the bungee jump first
oh we have this uh reverse bungee jump
oh reversed
yes
have you heard of it
and this is very accessible
it is uh right along the singapore river
so if you open your eye to get a lot to see while you are upside down
uh it is uh set up right next to our singapore river and uh i'm trying to get it
can you see the little picture on the right
that same space
oh
yes
uh hm one hundred percent pure nv adrenaline
okay i'll be honest with you i'm a coward i haven't been up on this
oh you haven't tried it
well it's good
yes
i yes
and it's very accessible
my nephew would like to ride
yes uh and you can you can also ride with him
no not me
no not me i'm just like you
i'm too scared
yah
uh a lot of tourists come here
reverse bungee and gla giant swing
okay
over seven countries
uh the zip-line i think you have to what is it you call it
can you give it to me again
zip-line
uh usually it's yah usually it's organised for groups like you know college students
zip-line
zip-line
yah
we used to have it on sentosa and uh i don't know if they still have it now
where you zip from one end to the other end right
yup
uh huh it looks exciting
well we have it a little bit out of town
uh okay zip-line adventure park
yes you have it
oh we have on sentosa right at the bottom but let me get to this one first
this is a megazip adventure park
yes it's on sentosa
okay let's go check out the website
you are brave if you dare to try zip-line
i did paragliding in uh thailand and uh my nieces thought i i
oh
did you enjoy it
did you enjoy it
oh i enjoyed it yes
i enjoyed it very much uh except that you know the insurance doesn't cover that
oh there you go
yah so you really have to be an adventurist to do it
zip-line is better i think
it's safer
yes
than bungee jumping right
it's awesome you feel like having one ride after
so it go it goes through from what point till what point
uh bungee jump uh it's the top of the hill i think
let me see huh
to the beach if i'm not mistaken
it looks good though
yes let me see it
all these especially at uh the big organisers like this they are very safe
don't have to worry
but what is the most but what is the most popular spot in hong uh rather in singapore that people go to
even the uh the youngsters they do this zip-line
and they also go on their what do you call it
roller blades and skateboards
uh it's a bit scary for people like me
uh oh there's another one that's a new one on sentosa
uh i forget the name
you'll get into a um oh dear what is it called
let me try
you get into uh a small building and you have these people help you float in the air
because the wind is blowing at you at high speed
uh you
oh that's that can be so scary
you put on a uh no you put on a suit
you put on a protective suit and you wear tennis shoes
i've done it so it can't be that scary
okay
you were able to survive it right
yes
we all survived it so don't worry
so even here can you see the harness is fully fitted
yes uh huh uh hm
uh that's what
so how much is it
how much will it cost me if i go to the zip-line
let me see if they have price
have you ever tried this
no
no um i was at the place where i could have tried it but uh i chickened out in the end
because it's too high speed for me
okay
i think you're still very young right
you sound very young
yes i sound young
it's a ploy
i
the zip-line prices are not on
i think uh it could be let me see
zip-line sentosa should have it
no they are showing
hm maybe sixty dollars
yah something like that
um sometimes they organise it for a group and then they have special prices
it's built-in with other adventures
how about for me right
i wanna go check out your um casinos
well i like playing the slots
where do i go
oh you can go into the casinos free of charge because you're a tourist
no where do i go to
um resorts world
sentosa
sentosa okay
yes sentosa has one
there's another one at marina bay sands
oh yah
i've heard about marina
both of them are casinos
yes
oh you're gonna show me a video
wow
wow
that oh that's long
oh
it's okay
no i cannot
i think
i don't have the stomach for it
i don't think i will be able to cross it
no
so i think it's from the top of the hill to one of the little islands there which is built off-just off the beach
so you're getting a view of the beach at sentosa
oh
yeah but the site is beautiful
wow
yes
amazing
uh what you are hearing is the sound of the wind
if you look at the video i think that's the sound of the wind
right now
uh just now when you saw the video with all the noise
that was the sound of the wind because they are travelling at high speed
uh now we are putting up for you
okay
we have another zip-line at bedok reservoir road
okay
are you getting it on your screen here
yes forest adventure or is it megazip adventure park
no me~megazip is what you just saw
so we're gonna go to forest adventure
oh see it's like
forest zip yes forest adventure
oh it can also oh okay
got it
okay
so
and okay
so do you know how much is it
do you know
do you have any idea how much it's gonna cost me if i go to forest adventure
okay i'm getting them on the line uh to see if i can get any prices here
okay booking
so there should be advance booking right
yes
because i think they need a minimum uh okay
so we have their numbers there
oh
yes and it's yes eight hundred number
so that will be fine so i can call them
alright
yes
oh so we i have to choose a date if i'm gonna go to forest adventure right
so i have to book ahead of time
that's right
hm yes
because they don't do it for you just for one person
they need to have a number of people
so you see here do you see here now
grand course time
okay oh so it's also by age right
places available
and your weight you cannot be too heavy
the line will not hold
oh no i guess i'm not gonna go to alright
alright
yah that is uh
because i think i will no i think i can
i'm not that heavy
so you have to book in it
i don't know
what so you like um uh you know like universal studio right
uh hm maybe yes
that and then um zip-line some shopping and
maybe what else
and maybe at least like little india right
some cultural sites
let me get your first
yah
it would be okay but we only remember we only have two days so it's gonna be a really hectic schedule
that's right
um if you are very keen on culture then little india stay would be good otherwise uh your uh m hotel would be good
oh i have i have a very good question ms. jeanne. i
i have a very good question ms. jeanne. i have a very good question
and then you see it took so
if i am a tourist visiting singapore for the first time
okay how many days would you advise me to stay in your country so i will be able to at least go through a lot of places
is it
i would say five days
five days is the ideal right
number
have five or six days
okay
i'm a relaxed traveller. i
i'm a relaxed traveller. i like to do things slowly
yes it's very hard if you're pressed for time
so yah
yah
right
if you're pressed for time and you only have two days to fit in all the places you would like to visit
i think that will be too stressful
so five days right
so five day will do
yes too stressful
yes
uh then you can go to other attractions you see
but if i only have like a budget of maybe right a thousand dollars would it get me to a lot of places though
uh you may have to downgrade your hotel
uh since you are able to travel by the mass rapid transit the train system let me get you on the mrt map
you can find that you can get anywhere on it
so maybe not too oh
i mean not do a lot of shopping maybe
maybe i can just buy some souvenir right stuff but not really shop because i mean i don't have a lot of like extra money to bring with me so i think i can only bring a piece of thousand dollars and that's it
yes
yes then if you spend your time-because when you shop you spend a lot of time
instead of that you can move to places
so i really yes on foot right
because i was thinking like maybe that's a good advice for me for us to downgrade our hotel and then try to like uh you know take mrt
uh yes
yes
that's right
then you can travel
do you see the map on your screen
and yes and don't shop a lot
just you know just enjoy the place
because there's a lot of places that we can go to in singapore right
and what about the food
what should i taste or try in singapore
what food
yes
uh try all the different kinds of food and uh if you are used to eating um you know adventurous in food you don't need to sit down at the restaurant
then again not only do you save money
but uh you get uh authentic local food and you can intermingle with the locals at the food centres
but what which one is your favorite
which one do you like eating the best
which one do you really like
i like a very old one
but first let me finish the map here okay
okay
uh can you see changi airport
yes uh huh
so if you take down the train down the green line
you just take it to tanah merah can you see it
just two stops away
look at number three on your right
can you see number three on your right
that's where changi
airport is
you would land at changi airport
uh yah
changi airport
so you just take a short shuttle to tanah merah and you take the westbound
and you would be in town
so depending on where you stay
okay
uh if you choose to stay in little india you will switch at city hall to dhoby ghaut
can you see the red line
at uh number eight
number eight is a major interchange station
okay
and if you move up to the little india stop there you are
okay
okay
in little india-in between little india and farrer park there are small uh hotels there
and i think we saw one of them just now right
okay
if you move the other way down to chinatown there are also many little hotels
okay
and these hotels are converted shophouses
okay
so it's uh bit of heritage that you're living in
okay so that's a
so
good location to i mean visit right
visit yes then you walk around
so if you're in little india you visit the little india area on foot
say in the morning
and then you can move by train to chinatown and visit chinatown on foot
little
and then yes
and also i can go to orchard maybe right
it's just not really that far
yes
orchard then you go connect the on the
you go back to dhoby ghaut which is the major interchange and full of shops there
you at
and eating places
you move north to orchard
in okay that sounds wonderful
you know what
so in little india you try the indian food
yah
okay
you're going to say
oh i like curry
i like to eat curry
yes curry you can get you take note of the name race course road
let me see if i can get it for you
there are lot of restaurants there
and along serangoon road which is the main road uh in little india you have many vegetarian restaurants also
in fact it's a great place uh for vegetarians in little india because many of the hindus here are vegetarian
okay
i read some i read it right
that you guys singaporean guys really like going to delis and you also are coffee drinkers right
oh yes
uh once you pay for a cup of coffee you can get a whole uh vegetarian meal in little india
or chinese noodles in chinatown you know like three four dollars
oh
oh
and you're okay to go right
for three to four dollars and you know
yes
you might need another uh a second portion if you have a healthy appetite
uh but otherwise you know uh it's uh more than enough
for me it's more than enough
okay
and we have this website called hungrygowhere
okay
and muthu curries is one of uh my favourite places
it's on race course
race course road
okay
the area used to be a race course in the days of the british
when
hm well let fish head curry
i'm gonna try that because it says here top must try dishes
fish head curry six votes
oh i'm gonna try that when i get there
it looks
yes
that's you can take chili right
you can take chilli
but not too hot
uh okay
you can tell them and maybe they can uh modify you modify a bit for you because we have many expatriates here but some of them like it really hot
the british expatriates uh love it hot
and also i ms. uh jeanne i also have one question
uh mirelle
are singa yah are singaporeans uh friendly people
i mean are they friendly
are you guys friendly or i mean can we ask question maybe if we're lost
can we approach you know just approach you and say excuse me can you tell us where is or can you give us directions
are you guys approachable and friendly too
yes
but you have to do the approaching
normally we mind our own business
so if you're lost we expect you to ask us and then we will be very helpful
but they will maybe not come out and approach you
although we're trying to change that mindset right now
okay
okay
so maybe i can say pardon or excuse me i'm kind of lost can you give us direction going to like orchard place or okay
i'll put that
yes
yes
they would be very helpful and if you get in to any train station uh the officers there would be very happy to direct you
okay
okay
i was supposed to show you the i want to just show you this about the uh okay
train you see the train map here
okay
are you getting the maps or ez-link card
this is a card we carry and i suggest you get it when you come
okay
oh so i don't have to like you know shell out change everytime i take the mrt right
that's right you don't have to worry about it
and the best place to get it is at the airport
okay so how how much is it
because uh what you okay
what is this
why am i getting this pictures
you see
okay
i think they tied up with a lot of people
uh with the ez-link card you can buy food as well
so if you put in a lot of money you have to put in money first when you buy the card
and then when you buy the card you um get benefits at certain places
okay
okay
okay
seve even sell them at seven eleven stores
okay
like as i said if you get it at the airport uh i think they can supply you with a little map to go with it
so how much is it
is it ten dollars twenty dollars
let's see
okay
can you see at the bottom of the screen
oh yes
okay
so it is like twelve dollars
uh twelve dollars yes
ten dollars and five dollars right
and uh yes that's right
uh when you buy it at seven eleven stores they only charge you ten
when you buy it at the post office outlets it's five dollars
wow
that's a lot of um discount if i you know buy it in singpost outlets
but no it's the top-up value
um you need to put in money on top of this value
uh okay
so it's just like a denomination right
okay
you see
that's right
yes that's right
so you put in money
so if you think you're gonna travel a lot you can put in more money
and when you leave at the airport leave some time to go back to the office and get your refund
oh okay
so i can use it and then everytime i use it right
so there will be like-my balance will not be as you know like twelve dollars from twelve dollars
it goes down to ten eight seven until there's not you know there is nothing left right
yes
yes
that's right yes
so uh normally at the singpost and seven eleven they think people are just using it as a convenience
so it's a bit cheaper yah but you can get your balance value so it's not a problem
okay
oh
okay
okay
so far i have my mind set that i'm gonna take um a re uh pardon um moderately-priced hotel
i'm gonna go to universal studio
maybe try forest adventure
go to little india and go to along orchard road and rangoon
is it rangoon
serangoon road is little india
okay
so
uh maybe when you do little india you do chinatown as well
because they're both of the same line
yes
two stops on the line
and then when you go to uh universal studios and the forest adventure you do it on another day
so uh that's what your two days will allow you to do
if you want more uh you need to stay about 5 days i think
then you need to visit you can visit attractions like the zoo the night safari the bird park
chinatown right
okay
and nature reserves
okay
okay
alright
sounds good to me
so i'm all set up
so i made up my mind and um thank you very much for your help
now if-do you have any additional right information that you want to tell me before right i end our call
maybe you can tell me some more attraction in your country
oh ah. uh the zoo the bird park and the night safari are places that tourists normally go to
and other attractions on sentosa island
so it's advisable to stay like five days right
max
like that so
yes
to be able to enjoy it
at least five days i think
yes
and you can spend one day shopping also
okay
if i still have money left i have to go into a lot of places we've talked about
i guess right why not
okay
okay
that's okay alright
so that's about it
so um perhaps i'll go to your country and i think it's a very beautiful country
and i enjoyed talking to you
and
and i look seeing you mirelle
i look forward
uh me too
alright
how old are you
if you don't mind how old how young are you
so do come mirelle

so maybe you can help me out
you haven't been to singapore before then
nope
i haven't
may i ask your age group
are you twenty to thirty
thirty to forty
forty to
oh you can make a good guess
i'm just kidding
uh i'm um turning twenty six this year
twenty plus
oh twenty six that's very young
yes
are you travelling with someone
um oh i haven't really thought about that
but maybe me and um i think i'm bringing a friend
so that makes it two of us yes
a friend
okay
so you can share
you can get a twin room right
um hm a twin room
i'm not sure
which is really good
how much would that be
twi twin is separate beds and uh uh twin and double is the same
is just that whether you have you want to squeeze-in one big bed or you want to have your own tiny bed
uh huh
uh huh that's right
but not really tiny but what i mean is single bed
some people don't like to sleep with other people because they toss and turn and bash them up in their sleep
uh huh
oh yes that's a good point
okay well um i'm on a limited budget
uh i actually have a thousand dollars singaporean dollars to spend for that trip
so can i afford a really nice room for me instead
yah
okay
ok oh yes
if you are staying just one night you have a good choices uh for uh that one night
well i'm not really particular about a five-star hotel
uh i just want the amenities to be there like the hm well what kind of amenities do i need
uh ac um i should have my own bathroom uh what else
um a fridge in the room stuff like that
not i don't need the kitchen i think
i just need uh not really a big room but not a very uh how to say not a very small enough for me to walk around but not you know bump on the bed or somewhere there
something like that
but not really fancy
i mean yes
so three-star you say
then you have a lot of money left over for only a thousand dollars
oh really
oh okay
huh
a three-star hotel
yes
just a minute
uh huh
okay
alright
the hotels would all have air conditioning in singapore
okay
and uh what you want is attached bathroom and you want a fridge
uh we also have uh okay we have a list here
uh huh
um hm i want
alright
yah but if you can get me a room with a really good view that would be nice
a good view
yes
well if i look out my window i don't wanna see another wall or another person's room
i want not really a spectacular view but uh a view that's not a brick wall or not a yes
not a view of the busy cars or buses on the street
yes something really nice
something that you don't see every day
okay
i've got you this hotel
it's called gallery hotel
uh huh
um hm sounds fancy
okay
are you getting it on your screen
yes i'm seeing gallery hotel right now
can you see the picture at the top
yah what is that
uh that's the view
you're looking at singapore river
and that's part of the theatres on the bay
uh huh
uh you can't quite see here
but on the right side of that picture uh some of the tall buildings in the business district
so it's really a nice view
and your hotel look at it on your right
uh huh
on my right
oh that's
oh yes
can you see
it is a sort of art piece with the different colours
oh right
it doesn't look like a hotel to me
yes
it's pretty nice
ex exactly
and it's right by the singapore river
so if you like to walk around in the evenings or even early morning it's a very nice place
okay will that fit my budget
let me see here
let's see the facilities that they have
yes
you've got internet interactive
oh yes i forgot to mention that
wi-fi will be really nice
uh connectivity
yes
okay
you have tv with remote cable
tea and coffee making facility hair dryer
bathroom amenities
they even give you your own bathrobe and bedroom slippers
oh very nice
and you can get a laptop workstation
but i don't think you want to work on one day do you
that's right
yes thanks
okay but um hm do you have pictures of the rooms in this hotel
pardon
are there pictures of the rooms in this hotel
let me see if they are pictures of
yes i hope they do
they should have
okay because if i will be staying for only one night i wanna make that night really comfortable
okay i'm looking for more images here
okay
ah yah
from the outside of the building it looks really nice yes
looks like a museum or some sort of yah
or maybe a department store no
uh there are shops nearby
you actually very near to chinatown across the river
do shopping and you could walk around uh in the evening
have meals there
is it safe there
yes safe
very safe
okay
oh there
what is that part of the hotel
you have the swimming pool
i think this is the dining area the middle picture
so it's very good class
i don't know why they call themselves three-star
the lobby is here
it's not big in size
but it's in a good location
i guess so
um hm that's right
yes
i think the view is really nice
and you said that it will fit my budget okay
yes and it let me see uh
you see okay
do you see the room view now
oh yes
oh that's a pretty nice wall art
yah
yah
okay
yes with that lady there right
uh huh
that's very nice
yes
oh that would be perfect
alright
well i'm staying for a one night or maybe two nights at the most
hm but during the day yes
i'd like to try out some things of course food would be number one
and then of course i would like to take pictures of myself all over singapore
so what would be the best places to visit
for food first
o okay
uh wait
just let me give you the rates first
did you ask me for the rate just now
oh yes
alright
yes i forgot about the rates already
okay yah
and you were asking me about the mer um about uh the places around
do you see the picture of what looks like a lion there
uh huh
oh yes
that is also within walking uh distance from your hotel
uh you walk along the river and uh you will reach it in no time
that's right
and behind is a first class hotel the fullerton hotel
oh
oh okay
fullerton alright
and there's also a museum nearby
that's great
so i'm waiting for the rates to appear right now
uh huh
oh okay that's really nice
it's nice to walk around the river
is that what you said
yes that is right
okay
because in case you come by yourself you know um these places are within walking distance
it's also the historic area uh with many colonial buildings from the time when we were under the british
and
yah
um hm
oh
bring your camera and take lots of photos
yes i probably do that
but from the airport how do i get to the hotel
uh just
alright
yah
let me just now the room rates
just a minute huh
okay
well i'd like to have a feel of
okay
alright
so
yes
just have a look at your room rates first
uh huh
oh where is it
okay there
it say single with breakfast is two two seven
twin with breakfast is also two two seven
oh
okay
alright
pretty okay
this is for one night right
yes one night
for one night
two two oh okay
gallery i'll probably take gallery twin or double
oh they are the same rate
so either one is okay alright two three eight is that
so either one is okay alright two three eight is that
that's that
uh huh
that's okay right
yah
okay
now you were asking me about uh what was your next question
uh huh
uh how do i get to the hotel from the airport
okay
let me get to the mass rapid transit
yes
i'm thinking uh the fastest uh way to get to the hotel or maybe how i can move about the city you know without much hassle
is it without much hassle i would say take
i mean traffic yah
you take the train which is the fastest
any traffic jams uh it's not affected by it
yes
alright
uh when i get lost in there cause i'm pretty bad with directions
so
no you wouldn't get lost because the signage is very good
and at the station when you arrive at the airport you will get a help from the station master or the officer uh at the station
uh huh
oh okay
so
so let me show you where you are
this is the map of the southern part of singapore
and if you are you getting the map
uh huh
yes i can see the map
can you see on the right-hand side number three in green
uh yes
number three
that is where the airport is
yes
oh okay
so if you go down to the basement when you arrive and buy a transit ticket i'll tell you more about it later
uh first you change some money and then you buy your transit ticket with a card
and uh you can use the card you top it up with money and use the card
before you go back you provide time to get a refund on the unused portion
okay
ah okay
they just hold back a little bit for the manufacture of the card
that is all
okay you travel along the green line
and you come to the let me see
you go down to outram park
can you see the purple line
where the green hits the purple right at the bottom
yes um hm. yah as
um hm yes
so you switch to the north line and you are at chinatown
uh huh
and
okay
if you go to the next stop clarke quay that's very near to your hotel
and if you yes
clarke quay is where you get off and you have to you may have to walk across the river
they don't show the
oh
the river there okay
the bridges across the river
but it's very nice
it's very pleasant walk
i've done it just for fun myself
uh huh
okay
okay well if you say so
okay i'll take your word for it
alright
yes that's yes
okay
so why didn't the why do the airport their the terminal or station for the train already
so and yes there's a train station there in the basement
and you can see it branching off right
there's number one there
yes
so what they have done is they have split it so that you have to take it only to tanah merah and then you take the westbound line
uh huh
you make sure you switch on the westbound or else you'll end up in another part of town called pasir ris
which is also fun
is a holiday area it's near the sea
oh alright
so if i get lost that would be okay too
oh um. yes that would be okay
uh but the signs are very clear
and if you ask anybody there most of them are working at the airport
they will direct you to the right direction
uh huh
okay
alright
so now i know how to ge go to the hotel from the airport
alright now let's go to food
alright
uh i'm not uh very how do i say this
i'm not very uh much of the i'm not into trying out vary dishes to me
so i want to eat singaporean food but not um hm well not that really exquisite ones
i just wanna try the simple dishes for singapore
okay
the simple food is it
yes simple ones first
uh you don't want to try like at the market or um you don't want to so is your stomach delicate or
oh
thank you for asking
uh i'm quite allergic to crustaceans to shrimps and yah
to those yes
but seafood only shrimps and crabs but everything else is okay
oh you are lucky
shrimps and crabs are quite expensive
crabs especially
they are not so cheap in singapore uh because singaporeans love it
oh really
okay
great
so if you go the food courts in the singapore you the good thing is you can actually see what you are eating
i can actually see oh
yah because they cook right in front of you
oh that would be great
and also i want the ambiance to be really nice cause i'll be yah
okay
uh then i suggest you eat near your hotel since you don't have much time
near my hotel oh
uh i believe that for lunch they were having a fifteen dollar promotion
i have noticed that all the restaurants were having that promotion so you could have your choice of italian western asian uh that's for lunch
dinner it's a different story because that is a nice place to be at
so the dinner prices go up quite a bit
and
uh huh
oh okay
yah
well for lunch is that buffet style
uh no usually it's a set meal
and they stipulate what you are eating
so um you are sort of told exactly what you are going to eat exist
oh
oh i see
up and via singapore
okay
something that you might want to try in singapore
oh
we've got these restaurants here
uh but they are uh not in your location
but i'm trying to look for a dish
okay
it's okay if i have to travel a little bit cause i want to do some exploration too but maybe not too far cause i might get lost
but a place where in hm not too crowded cause i want to enjoy my meal
so i want a place that serve really good food and then
okay
okay this place is good
it's let me try and get it for you
it's called crystal jade and it's at holland
uh holland uh is not name after the country it's named after an architect
oh yah
okay
uh you can take the train and uh you will uh end-up at holland just nearby and you can just walk here
and this place is called crystal jade
they have a chain of restaurants all over
i think so yah
but holland has got uh nice ambiance also so you might want to walk around there
okay what about inside the restaurant
is it nice inside
yes it's nice it's simple but it's nice
it's not posh so it won't break your bank
but it serves uh better than average chinese food i think
oh chinese is good yah
uh do you know this dish xiao long bao
it is a little dumpling
oh i think so
uh i it's sound familiar
yah steamed and it's actually got a bit of soup inside the dumpling which is unusual
ah yes i've heard of it
i haven't really tried it though
so you see the prices here
spending twenty one dollars to thirty dollars
is that uh cheap or okay
okay a cheap meal at the food centre uh simple noodles would be only three dollars
so if you have two plates six dollars
so this is more expensive than that
and more than the fifteen dollar set meal that you get down by the river where you are
yah
okay
well twenty one yah maybe hm uh i'm not sure
but are there other places that i can
if you want indian food
do you want indi
indian food oh yes
indian food could be nice
wait let me get you
can like grills and um kebabs yes
yes uh
they also have it there
there's a place there's a place called race course road in singapore
located where there used to be a real race course in the early days
oh i see
and there are full of indian restaurants there
okay i'm just gonna go
okay
yes
indian restaurants
race course road restaurants in singapore
okay
so here we have a list of them
is that far from the hotel
uh on the northeast line uh there's a stop right at little india
so when you get off the train station you just walk
uh huh
so we have the chinatown and then this one is little india
and yes that is right
okay alright
and these are the major restaurants there
banana leaf i go there myself
um banana leaf means you actually eat off a clean banana leaf
oh i see
that's hm i'm not sure if i wanna eat in a on a banana leaf
hm but is the food good
uh is the food is good
it's also hot if you like hot food
yes i like that
but you see here they have north indian and they have south indian
so if you don't go for too much hot food you can go for the north indian
oh there's a difference
oh i didn't know that
yes
south indian food cuisine is quite hot
chili hot
okay
chili hot okay
and the north indian is milder
is got spices but it is not so burning on the tongue
uh huh
okay
wow
good advice
and we have something called fish head curry
have you heard of it
fish head curry
curry yah i've heard of curry
but not fish head curry
they got they get the head of a big fish and they cook curry with uh tomato and lady's fingers and a little bit of tamarind so it's slightly sourish
and it's the favourite of the locals here
and then
oh i see
okay
we'll uh i'm into desserts and sweets too
i've heard of uh chewy junior cause we have that here already
and i heard from some of my friends that you also have it in singapore
chewy what do you call it
uh the chewy junior
ch chewy junior let me see
yes i think there are cream puffs
oh
have you heard of it
uh no but we have similar things
uh huh
there do you see junior but i got it here junior singapore
yes the fi i think that's the first one
yes chewy junior singapore
now i'm learning something from you
it's at bugis junction
uh yes the
it's also on the train
oh it's also on the train
oh great
yah the bugis is uh one of the stops of on the east-west line
say vanilla cream cream puffs doughnuts
that's right
yes and it's so you could also shop there if you want that whole area
oh i can shop there
uh huh
yes and uh
what can i buy there at that area
uh there is a lane there that you can shop
it's in this bugis area right across the road
you can see there's a small lane and they have lots of little stalls on either side
so if you are looking
um is that like a flea market of some sort
uh if you could yah i guess you could call it a flea market
uh huh
a bit more organised than a flea market
oh okay
uh huh
where is it again to jeanne
it's right on the train station
and the train station is called bugis
bugis is the name of the uh one of the peoples from indonesia that came over and settle there uh two hundred years ago
bugis okay
bugis
oh and then it's the train station is named after them okay
yes but they are no longer you know
they've inherit they've inter-married with the local malays and they have the people have the malays have merely moved out to the eastern side
so this is like a major shopping area there are offices there as well
there
uh huh
okay
well you mentioned shopping
i've heard that yes there um like accessories and clothes and shoes
uh as you've known uh i'm on a tight budget so i have like uh a really i'm spending three hundred dollars for shopping
a little bit of accessories and maybe some shoes
do you think i can buy things with three hundred dollars
yes you can buy lots of things
at bugis there is a big shopping centre uh it's called bhg
bhg okay
what is that stand for
it stands for be here for good
because they took over the store from another store that closed
okay
so i'm not joking
it's true
oh
oh okay
be here for good alright
yah
but the nobody knows i mean not very few people bother what is about
so you gotta look for bhg and it's at the bugis station
and like i said across the road where that little alley is the bugis lane you can look for lots of funky clothes you might like them
uh t-shirts and things shoes
uh huh
have you shopped there
yes you can buy a lot of things there
uh huh
and if i
there you
if i wanna buy a souvenirs so that i can bring them home with me
where can i get really nice souvenirs
you can get them there
and also walk to chinatown from your hotel
and when you're at little india if you go a little bit earlier for your dinner you go across the road to little india arcade and you can get lots of souvenirs there too
uh huh
oh right
well so far uh i've i'm seldom where i'm going to stay the hotel how to get to the hotel from the airport food and shopping
but that's not a pretty nice vacation
so i'm thinking of doing some activities but i have no idea what to do and usually yah
what do you suggest i do
okay i'm put up find you some uh i what are you interested in
uh huh
hm i like watching no movies i can do that at home
um hm maybe watch a show
but not movies not a place
what exactly
you're talking about a live show
maybe performances yes
something like that
performances
okay
i think i forgot
well if you are open-dated about your arrival uh i would recommend that you go i put the wrong the spelling
just a minute
we have a lovely theatre by the river and it's also within walking distance of your hotel
it's called the theatres on the bay
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh
theatres on the bay
what do they showcase there
there are two major theatres and smaller studios
uh wait
let me get it the ticketing
uh huh
so there are concerts and there are also uh shows um sort of during the different periods of time like during chinese new year we have more chinese themed concerts
during the indian festival time they have indian musicians coming and indian concerts
uh let me see
so you're talking about show i'll go to the theatres on the bay and see if i can a calendar
i like uh maybe singers or hm magic shows those kinds of stuff
uh magic shows
sorry
it's something that you can't see every day or you can't watch every day or something that you can't catch easily on tv or in the internet i'm not sure
oh
okay
yah just something to yah
do on an evening before maybe or after you have taken your dinner
ah okay
something that's nice to do before you sleep
something like that
theatres
ther okay just give me a moment to get back there
i'm trying to get to their programme section
okay
is it expensive though
uh it depends on the type of show
if it's an international artist you are watching then it's expensive
oh
but if it's uh something not so somebody not so well-known or high profile then it's a little bit better
a little bit better
uh huh
okay
just let me
sure
okay well that's one i can think of right now
but actually i have no idea of what i want to do when i get there instead uh aside from eating and having a tour in the city
but af
because you are staying one day and it is a bit limited
oh
yah you know
so how many days should i stay to have a good um feel in singapore
i think five days is good
five days
oh i don't have that much time
yes then you go uh we have good shows at marina bay sands that's where one of the casinos is
uh but
uh huh a casino
yah good
you know the casino theatre
a casino theatre okay
i haven't seen any shows in a casino theatre
but casinos are nice
yes
okay
uh you don't have to gamble there if you are just seeing the show
okay
but if i'm staying for two days and one night only what am i supposed to see or where am i supposed to go if i visit singapore to make my trip complete
what are the hm main attractions
if you like heritage then little india and uh chinatown uh to walk around it's very exciting
and then to try some of the local food
and then in evening you might want to uh go and see the shows what the one show
yah
the show at night
okay
well i'd like i'd like to take some photos of myself all over the place
so where are good spots where i can take photos
by the river just outside your hotel
just outside the hotel
yes and walk down the river towards the bay where the merlion is
merlion
oh it's right there
yah the merlion
have you heard of the merlion
yes
why is that a symbol of singapore by the way
it's a it is a symbol for the singapore tourism board originally uh because a prince that came to singapore thought he saw an animal and he was wondering what it was
and someone told him it's a lion
but we have no lions in singapore
no records of lions
so we think he saw perhaps a tiger or a big deer and because we are a uh you know we are an island and we were a fishing village and now we are an international sea port so we have the mer for mermaid and for the sea
and then the lion for the what the prince thought he saw
so we have the top and the bottom joined together
and
oh
okay you see do you see the singapore river
ye oh that's it okay
yes i can see it
so your hotel is nearby here where you see river valley road on the top left
okay in that vicinity is your hotel
it's a very pleasant walk down the river and you can cross the road and get on to the north side
you will be passing bars and eating places along the way
and you can take lots of photos of yourself
right on the edge is the merlion park
um i see
and you can get lots of tourists or tour guides to help you take photos there
okay
well the hotel sounds like it's very nice
but if i for example i want to stay at a like a small house
sorry again
if the hotel sounds really nice but if i would like to stay in a small house can i rent one for a day
uh huh
a house for a day
um i am not sure about that
renting a house for one day uh i am not sure
i can't confirm that
but you can rent a room in uh places that's uh are for expats settling into singapore
do you know what i mean
wait
um hold on
no it's okay
i'm sorry
hello jeanne i'm sorry
yes my throat got suddenly itchy
uh huh
uh yah you having a cough huh

but anyway okay
i hm the hotels sounds nice okay
but hm and it seems like everything is quite within the vicinity okay
so i think that's really good
that would be enough for my trip
okay then
i'm glad
i hope you will think about staying five days and not just one day
oh yah
i would love to stay there for five days but yah i can't afford that much uh yah
longer vacation
okay

but i don't think you can a rent house for one day

okay
thank you
ac you said if you go to the you know when i told you you take the wrong journey from the airport there's a holiday um there are holiday bungalows that you can rent
uh there are actually for parties for one night
so uh usually people rent them to throw a wild party away from where people live okay
oh

oh my god
hello
hello good afternoon
hello good afternoon
my name is jeanne

what is your name please
um i'm participant nineteen
my name is euke
yuki
yuki y u k i
yes
uh not the the spelling is not y u k i but e u k e
oh
yes it's
e u k e okay that's
yes it's a different spelling of the name euke
uh it's very original
yes it sounds unique
hm yes
how can i help you euke
oh by the way i'm planning to have a trip to singapore with my girlfriend this coming the fourth until the sixth of april
okay fourth to the sixth of april
but but i don't know where to go
i haven't been to singapore yet
uh may i know are you both in your twenties or thirties
uh yes
we do
okay
uh what is your budget for coming
i only have one thousand singaporean dollar in my pocket
is that for both of you or for just
no for just for me just for myself
for yourself uh
so do you mind if you go to a budget hotel
uh it's fine as long as it's affordable
and it goes with my budget
okay
okay
and you can take public transport around singapore
we have got very good uh transportation system by rail
mass rapid transit and also by buses
uh they're all air conditioned
okay
so your thousand dollars could uh very well uh be enough for the both of you
it's just for the land arrangement right
oh
uh hm that's cool
oh by the way how much is the airfare from the philippines to singapore
airfare i think there are various airlines um. you might want to can you travel on cebu air
are you able to from where you are
yes
you mean cebu pacific
yes that's right
alright
so how much would it cost for me to go to singapore
okay
i'm on the cebu pacific website now or rather i'm trying to get on to it
alright
uh it would be a round trip ticket
it's origin would be is it manila
manila
yes
from manila to singapore
a round trip ticket
i prefer a round trip ticket
manila and your destination is singapore
yes
okay
and departure date is the fourth of april
yes it is the fourth of april
until the sixth of
okay
yah
april yes
until the sixth
okay just give me a moment
alright
take your time
oh by the way ma'am what's your religion
i'm a catholic
oh you're a catholic
is it are you too
many of my filipino friends are
yes i yes
i am catholic too but i don't think if there are catholic churches in singapore
oh there are plenty
in fact uh ninety per cent of our choir members are catholic
okay
oh
so that's better
so we depend on them to sing for us
uh okay
yes
oh by the way from let's say for example i already arrived in singapore airline uh airport
will you pick me up at the airport
oh from the airport you can easily take the mass rapid transit that we call the mrt
uh huh
and you can come to singapore from there
uh alright
you mean to say that uh there is no tourist guide that will accompany me from the time we arrived at the airport
uh you there are
you can but you know you have a limited budget
if you get a guide to pick you up and send you to town by limousine and all that it will be expensive
it's very easy to do a free and easy uh by yourself when you arrived
alright
so how much if i add how much what if i add um two thousand singaporean dollar for my budget
uh would it be
your two thousand dollars if you're just staying a few days you could get a car to pick you up from the airport
oh so you mean to say that if i have three thousand singaporean dollar in my pocket there is a tourist guide that will pick me up at the airport
but let yes you can be picked up from the airport
you can do all your tours privately
okay i think that's
uh but let me get back to your uh question about the fare
alright
you see it there
april the fourth on your screen
cebu pacific air
from manila to singapore
alright
so those are all the flights
and uh unfortunately because maybe it's so close to the date
yes
um the promotional fares are not available but i can see here six thousand nine hundred and ninety nine dollars
yes okay
uh for filipino peso i don't know how that got uh how that connects
uh what's the
yes
the conversion
you mean the conversion you don't know the conversation
yes
yah conversion
yes um
uh i think it's around two thousand or more than two thousand singaporean dollar the value of that
for the fare
yes
oh that's high
yes i think it is
but it's fine but because i really want to travel
i really want to go to singapore because i want to see how beautiful it is
uh what part of singapore are you think what are your interests
actually i'm into i love animals so i wanna go to the zoo if there is
okay
oh which is the best zoo in singapore
we have only one zoo in singapore
alright
and it's part of an organisation
called uh wildlife reserves
wildlife reserve is that right
so yes that's right
and you can visit the zoo in the day
and then walk to the night safari which is just next door
and you can visit the night safari to see the nocturnal animals
let me get on their website huh
how much is the fee
just a minute
yes
how much is the fee at the zoo
uh if you buy a ticket for all the attractions it's much cheaper
alright
okay
how far will i go with a thousand singaporean dollar in my pocket
uh it's uh it depends on where you stay
if you don't spend a lot on your uh hotel accommodation
you'll be able to visit a lot of places
i can go anywhere with that with a thousand dollars
yes you can get hotels about a hundred over dollars
you can get hotels at a thousand over dollars
so
um if you save on the accommodation then you have more money to visit attractions
okay
so how
and uh if you don't take the taxis and you don't hire a private guide then you use public transport you save a lot of money
alright
so for example you will tour me alright
so you will be my tour guide because i don't know anything about your culture your customs
so i might get lost also because i think it's a big country
however if you will tour me in singapore how many hours per day will you be with me
you haven't been around you haven't been to singapore before right
how yes
so normally we do a city tour where we bring you to the ethnic areas
uh like chinatown little india
and the malay quarter if you like where we have an old mosque
and these are the heritage areas where the buildings are conserved for future generations to enjoy
we would also bring you to the historic area by the singapore river
where we have um the merlion which is the symbol of singapore
okay
and you can in fact take a riverboat ride in the bay
it's very scenic and it's very good for photography
so on the tour we would tell you things about singapore like the population
uh that we have a mixed culture of chinese malays and indians we have
alright
so
buddhist christians oh
yah we're there
you tour me in different places in singapore
can i took pictures or are we allowed to take pictures
yes i think it's only in the airport that it is uh restricted
uh so usually you can take pictures
it's just that if you are in a place of worship like a temple or a mosque um it's better to ask for permission from somebody who seems to be in charge
alright
so that you know officially you've got permission
uh usually we don't take pictures of people who are praying but of the architecture
okay
but do you have do's and don'ts for a tourist like me
uh i beg your pardon
uh do you have any do's or don'ts for a tourist like me
uh okay
uh do's or don'ts um generally you don't smoke where there's a non-smoking area like in the restaurant
okay
they have only a certain part of the place where you can smoke
de there's a designated area and it says that you can smoke
so it's limited to a very small percentage of the total area of the restaurant
alright can for example i brought my phone with me and then can i use my phone while we were sort of touring or touring like with uh
uh sorry you want to use your phone while you are touring you can
okay
but you can't use if you hired a car you can't use your phone and uh drive at the same time
you know what i mean
i think it's more fine
yah
okay what is the best travel secret you can divulge to me
travel secret
yes
uh i say get a train pass and then google for places when you're in singapore and pick up the tourist brochures on arrival when you are at the airport
alright
so that even if you don't have a computer you can look at the brochures and you can have a quick look at what you like and don't like
and then we have uh people at the airport that can tell you how you can get there
okay
uh if that will save you a lot of money because you don't have to hire a cab
you don't have to actually hire me as a guide
uh huh
or private car because hiring someone privately will cost you more money
alright so because i think that once i get in where i book for a trip to singapore you will tour me there
uh so it shows to me that it happens in a different way
you uh you can plan it also before you go
let me try and get these parks for you
it was a bit slow downloading
uh yes
for the wildlife reserves right
because i really do love animals
actually here in the philippines i went to different zoos
yah
uh huh
yes
there is a package ticket
i think it's about forty five dollars or forty dollars that you can pay to visit the bird park or the zoo and the night safari
and because you are you know short of time
uh you i suggest that you visit the bird park on one day at the same day that you do your city tour or you know you travel you can travel by yourself to little india and the ma
actually it's affordable
i can see here that the tour rate for or in the zoo is only eighteen dollars
yes that's right
yes it is
but you see the three in one special there
can you see
it's fifty eight dollars and you visit all three
oh wow
uh i think i will my girlfriend and i would prefer uh three in one
yah
you
tour in the safari
the night safari and the zoo are located next to each other
okay
and you just walk across the car park
so you can visit the zoo in the afternoon
at the same time
yes and then walk across the night safari
and then if you're energetic and you want to have one whole day for something else
yes
you could go to the bird park first in the morning
yah alright
because uh this is my plan on our first day we'll go to the zoo
so here's the thing uh i will be for the three in one package
uh because zoo is in singapore so it's only fifty eight dollars
so
but eh could you speak a bit louder please
uh alright
alright uh
okay
so here is my plan
i on the first day we decided to go to the zoo
so i prefer to take the three in one package
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh
in of the zoo
so in the morning we'll go to jurong bird park um in the afternoon
uh i can't hear you
hello
yes
i can guess you said morning you're going to the bird park
yes
afternoon to the zoo and the night safari in the evening
yes in the evening
yes i think it's affordable
then on the second day because i really love the sea i wanna go swimming right there
nice beaches in singapore
is that right
yes
uh okay i lose you now and then
but
hello
yes okay
i'm getting you now
alright
uh i sugg okay
so when you go to the bird park you buy the three in one ticket
now yes
uh normally i think you have a month to use it up
but you can use it up within a day it's not a problem
uh if you are tired by the time you reached the night safari or the zoo you can take a tram ride
but it's really nice to walk around these places
and you just have to remember to keep your three in one ticket the minute you buy it
okay so i will take note of that
um and then i think if because it's a big day
uh huh
you see we will go into the bird park in the morning
the singapore zoo in the afternoon
night safari in the evening
so for sure we will be
uh huh
uh i'm losing you
hungry
hello
uh yes
oh you're okay you are back
alright
so for sure we will be hungry on that time
alright
now where in your place where's the best place to have dinner around singapore
yes
uh actually if you are going to walk from the zoo to the night safari you will have a limited choice of places to eat. you
you will have a limited choice of places to eat. you i suggest you eat inside the night safari
oh there are restaurants inside the night safari
restaurants
yes then
yes there are restaurants and there are like burger places if you don't want to eat a full meal
okay
because to do the three in one you are a little bit limited in time
so what oh yes
so you might want to leave your eating for the next day
oh what about if we bring what about if we bring food while um roaming the zoo or the park are we allowed to do it
yes you are allowed to do it
uh we have also fast food outside so if you want to buy and
bring
while you're walking around the zoo you nibble on the food it's fine
it's okay if we bring the food that we buy in the fast food restaurant
so it's fine to bring it inside
it's fine it's not a problem
uh it's just that you should be aware that you shouldn't leave litter around
alright
so it's one of the prohibitions in your country that we don't have to litter anywhere right
yes
you should try and keep our places clean and usually people do adhere to that rule
so what if i don't know any rules about that
i'm throwing pieces of litter every anywhere
usually the places there are signs to remind you not to litter and usually it's at places where you eat
uh so that you are mindful and there will be lots of bins around for you
uh alright
yes because it's actually we i am aware that singapore is the cleanest city in the world
uh well one of the cleanest cities
i won't say it is the cleanest
uh we do have a lot of cleaners to pick up after ourselves actually
eh yes it is
yes
and oh by the way on the second day
yah
i prefer to go to the beach
so
okay
would you
you want to go to the beach
would you mind to look for nice beaches in your country
i think one of the nicest beaches is on sentosa
sentosa
it is an island
alright
and this beach actually has a filipino name it's siloso beach
oh
siloso means jealous right or jealousy
siloso means jealous right or jealousy
yes uh
uh actually it's uh it's spa siloso
yah jealousy
it's spanish time siloso
jealousy yah
uh i see
we are not sure how that name came about
uh but we do have uh very good views here i'll show you of the beach
there you go
if you get into the island uh there's no charge for swimming except if you use the lockers
that's all
alright
wow it's a very nice place
yeah
oh it has white sand
yes very good
uh and the you know it's safe
it is uh
i think it's very romantic when i when we go there
yes indeed it is very romantic
and uh you can also stay until the night time
we have bus
and restaurants there
but if you don't want to spend so much money there are also uh food stalls or rather shops that sell food that is not very expensive
alright so how much is a one day stay in that beach
the beach when you enter the island it's a two dollar charge
okay
and another dollar for public bus
upon entering is two dollars
yes
and one dollar if you take the public bus in which i suspect you will need to after on your visit to all the parks you'll be a bit tired
uh huh
yes
uh and then on the beach it's free
but i'm asking if the beach is free
free yes it's free
what about the cottage
so if we will rent the cottage
so how much would it cost
oh we don't have a cottage
we usually just set up a place underneath the coconut tree or uh some people even just
oh
uh hang out at where the food places are
oh really so that's how you do it
yes because we it's you know it's very open
it's cool and breezy
uh maybe if the sun is out it's a bit warm
so we try and hide under the shelter of some trees
alright because i thought it's um sentosa is a resort
yah there are resort hotels there
but usually for the resort hotels you stay in the hotels
yes
overnight
yes for what about if we stay there for an we stay overnight there so how much would it cost
you would have to stay at the hotels
yes
uh that would burst your budget a little bit
a little bit
uh yes
the hotels are a few hundred dollars
alright
uh it's okay
a few hundred dollars
uh then you might want to stay at the nice hotels there and you can just come out and swim
that's fine
it includes accommodation right
uh yes i mean if you're checking in to the hotels you are staying at the hotels on sentosa
you are staying on the island in the hotels
okay
so then after that so we're done with the second day
we will go to the beach so here's the thing on the third day
i really love literature so i love reading books
books. you want to go to the museum or you want to buy books
books. you want to go to the museum or you want to buy books
yes
uh yes
i want to go to the museum if there is any
uh did you say museum uh on books
did i hear books
is that right huh
no i what i said was i love reading books so and i'm into literature so i want to go to museum and
uh okay
yes
and i want to look for beautiful artefacts
okay
regard about your country
oh there
okay are you getting the resort now
yes
so these are the hotels that are available on the ho on the island so that's quite different from a budget hotel
right
the other end
so it's how much would it cost for upon arriving
let me let me try to get it for you huh
april the fourth
on the fourth you're coming in
right
on the fourth
uh the fifth
no on the fifth
is that sorry i thought it's the fourth
it's the fifth is it
yes because on the fourth we will go to the zoo right
no but if you want to stay at the hotel don't you want to stay you mean you want to change hotels
uh it's fine if we arrived there on the fourth
it's okay
so the fourth is the first day then
yes until sixth
alright
okay
and uh you are departing on the
sixth
sixth huh
yes
after we go to the museum
okay
okay that's two adults huh
so yes
so let's see if it's available first
you may not want to go anywhere once you stay in this hotel
oh yes
because it's well-ventilated and the scenes are the scenes outside are really nice so i prefer to stay rather than roaming around
it's really
yes that's right
so okay these are the rates at the moment
which is actually quite attractive five hundred and seventy dollars
oh it's fine
so it's two eight five a day
yes
actually it's uh it's affordable
oh
oh it's
yah it's affordable
yes correct
it's affordable
it's affordable
yes it is
for a resort hotel i think it's very affordable
yes
oh alright so i think um i will choose that the resort in sentosa
i'll stay there for 3 days
and you wanted a museum right
yes
i give you one of our nice museums
uh it's the asian civilisations museum
alright could you tell me eh something about the history of singapore
we well we have been for years uh thought of as a just a fishing village until the british came
okay
uh in 1819
and uh we became a colony until 1942 when the japanese arrived and occupied singapore until 1945
but recent archaeological diggings have found that in fact there was trade here over a thousand years ago
i see
oh i see
so we do have an earlier history that we are not very uh familiar with because of the lack of written history
in china there are some records
okay
alright
now what's the best delicacy in singapore
um are you thinking of chinese or indian
or the famous what's the famous cuisine
um chicken rice is quite famous
it's the rice the chicken is cooked in boiled in soup
and some of the or rather the water of the soup for boiling the chicken is used for cooking the rice
and a little bit of oil is added
so the rice is fragrant and it's oily and we put in the pandan's leaf
i think you're familiar with that
it has a nice fragrance
rice huh
i yes
but uh so you mean to say that to prepare it um a chef would prefer to mix it all together the rice and the chicken
uh he cooks the chicken and then he cook he takes out the chicken and he cooks the rice separately uh with the stock that he's used to cook the chicken
so you
alright so what happened to the meat of the chicken
so when you order uh he will chop up the portion you like whether it's the thigh the wing or the breast
um so is there a sauce
yes there is
is there a sauce where i can dip it
there's a thick uh good quality black sauce chinese black sauce
and there are some restaurants that you give uh grated ginger
and chili
the chili has got vinegar
so maybe not if you're with your girlfriend it might be a bit stinky after that
okay
now is there a restaurant which offers filipino cuisine
uh there are restaurants
there's one in the east coast
uh a place called east coast road
and if you come on uh saturday sunday uh most filipinos are at the place called lucky plaza
and there on the fourth or fifth floor there are uh places selling filipino food
but i wouldn't categorise them as being restaurants
uh because they are more the filipino people so it's quite affordable prices
so there is no restaurants which is owned by a filipino and caters filipino cuisine
these places they are i think owned by filipinos and uh it's just that they're not high-end you get what i mean
uh yes
yes
uh and well i personally know of people who get filipinos to cook for their parties
very good food um filipino food
and they just do it on a personal basis but they charge for it
alright then i'm also into movies so uh do you have what's this
actors or actresses singaporean celebrities
oh
do you also have do you also have like that
so wait
uh wait
can i just show you the museums first
because you're asking me the website that has come out here
so we have uh in the museums we also have sometimes temporary exhibits from other countries uh that come in
like we have textiles do you see here
uh yes
yes i do
from india and let me see
that's up to june so it will be here when you are here
and we have tank shipwreck gold and ceramic you see what i mean
alright
yes
the shipwreck that was found off indonesia has got a lot of items there that shows that there's trade in this region uh that passed through singapore
alright
so you mean to say when we arrived there and we go to the museum we will be able to see the some artefact from india and china
yes
and the permanent exhibits we also have artefacts from india
that's the permanent
the ones you see here are special exhibitions that are here for a short period only so they're very special
oh uh hm
uh so i
but i think we won't be able to oh yes i we still be able to watch the tank shipwreck and then the patterns of indian
yes
much as the trade of india
yes you can
yes
so will be aside from these special exhibitions what other artefacts would we see or would be seen in the museum
it's uh there is one with art and craft from sarawak jewellery uh and uh bas woven clothings that the villagers used to make
uh part of the exhibit is on loan from a collector who went into the jungle and bought up the items
alright
that's one of my favourite places also
and we have another museum this one is called peranakan
okay
uh this is an exceptional culture
it's a mix of chinese and malay
alright now i'm gonna ask you um are you single
uh no i'm married
oh you're married alright
now i think%um you are the best person to ask
yes uh hm
oh where do you usually go with your husband
oh we sometimes walk along the bay you know by the singapore river
okay
and then we stop and have a sandwich or have ice cream
there are lots of joints along the singapore river
so it's very relaxing
and i and i think that should be more romantic while walking along the bay with your husband while holding hands right
i think that is romantic
i prefer that it would be very romantic instead of uh going to the zoo um watching artefacts in the museum or swimming on the swimming in the beach
i think i prefer that one walking along the bay hm
uh hm uh huh
huh uh yes
uh you could visit the earlier museum
how do i get there
museum i told you the asian civilisations museum
that is
uh huh
yes
right by the river
oh it is
so yes
uh so if you have time and you want to squeeze in two museums i suggest you go to the peranakan and then the asian civilisations
and then in the evening you could walk by the river
so it's cooler it's very nice
uh huh
so from the what's the name of the museum again
asian civilisations
the one where you see the tank exhibits
pardon
uh okay asian civilisation museum
alright
so from the asian civilisation museum how do i get to the river singapore river
when you come out you're looking at it
when you come out of the museum you're looking at the river
oh i will be able to see it at once
yes that's right
and you can also see the merlion but the merlion is crowded with tourists so if you walk the other way uh you cross the river you walk down there
uh what do you mean the merlion
the merlion is the emblem of singapore uh tourism
oh it's the landmark
you mean the landmark
uh that's the that's right
the one that's half-fishtail and half-lion's head
that's at the mouth of the river
yes and it it has uh what's this
it is there is a water flowing on its mouth
yes that's right
uh that's also a nice place to walk it's just that it's not very quiet
it's you can see the bay you can see um the marina bay sands hotel which has become very iconic
uh lovely views that are very uh attractive for courting couples
i often see a lot of them there
hm that's good
and uh it's a long day of travel i guess or a vacation so uh
would could you bring me or could you send me to the finest restaurant in singapore
oh
the finest restaurants
you could go to the uh swissotel the stamford
okay
and it's also within the area you go to the top of the hotel
swissotel
yah the stamford
it's used to be called the westin stamford
and right at the top where you get very good views
it's a restaurant
oh i see
okay
you could also stay there if you wanted to
okay if you look at the map here
can you see the map
uh where you see this dot is the hotel
and your museum is just a little bit further down
just down here and that's the river here
that's the bay
uh the little blue patch on your right
oh i see
yes i can see it
um marina frometan is that right
pardon
marina promenade
yes that's right
so let me see if they have the hotel the restaurant here
how much is the taxi fare to this
uh taxi fare you mean from where
from the hotel is that
to
from the hotel to the museum
oh uh which hotel did you say you wanted to stay at
uh the one on the hotel at uh sentosa right
uh yah sentosa
the hotel in from in sentosa
the hotel would ac
we'll stay there
the hotel would actually have a uh shuttle into town
oh oh they do so s
um i'm not sure if they stop you right there but where this where swissotel is uh they have you see can you see the restaurant now on your screen
yah
uh yes i do
it's quite um wow i can see the view outside
yah
yes lovely isn't it
it is
indeed
and they also have convention facilities
wow
yes
but so as you mentioned earlier the hotel in sentosa has a shuttle
but you don't you are not sure if the shuttle drops off um in the museum right
so
it have
they may if you ask the concierge
they might be able to accommodate you
but i know they will drop off in the town area like orchard road and also where there's dining places
because these are major areas uh for shopping
so um is the travel fare for the shuttle included in the hotel accommodation
the shuttle uh to get into the hotel is just one dollar
yes what i mean is
uh to into the hotel
uh huh
the accommodation in the sentosa resort is um five hundred eighty singaporean dollars right
so does it include the shuttle fare
i no i don't think they bring you right to the hotel
you would have to pay extra for the shuttles
the transfer you're talking about transfer from the hotel right
you are talking about from the hotel when you arrived at the airport
uh yes
no it will not include
okay
how far would i get there um how far would i get to sentosa hotel from the airport
you can get to just across the island at uh harbourfront
so how many minutes would it take
by the public transport maybe forty minutes
forty
yah forty minutes
around one hour
forty minutes
yes or yah that's because you have to make a change and i'm uh putting in extra for you asking for directions and all that
it would be less than one hour
oh i see
alright but as you mentioned all the fares in zoo the hotel accommodation for the hotel accommodation and then the museum i think i can go far with the one thousand singaporean dollar i have in my pocket
yes you will go very far because you're staying only two nights
uh but uh
yes
uh you might have to top-up a bit for your expensive dinner
yes of course
um yeah
uh of course
but for the tour itself i prefer to i have um a thousand singaporean dollar budget for just the for the tour
uh uh excluding the food allowance or the air fare
uh okay
so only for the travel itself
i think from the uh what i mean is only for the tour itself
uh a thousand dollar singaporean dollar is enough
yes it's enough
yes it's more than enough
yes
yes
and
because as you mentioned that i can enter the zoo for around sixty five to seventy five singaporean dollars right
yes
for yah that's for three all three attractions the zoo the bird park and the night safari
for tour attractions it's a little over forty dollars i think
yes
yes
yah it's okay
but um i prefer to go for the three attractions in the zoo
and then for the museum i think it won't cost much
no it's uh very cheap
you go on the next day in the morning free and easy after you wake up
so yes
because it's a public uh what's this
building so it's a public architecture so it's i think for free
uh no it's not for free
you will have to pay uh it depends if there is a special exhibit on i believe it's eight dollars or so
oh yah
so it's still very cheap
alright
if you're a senior citizen you get a lot of discounts but you're not
yes
but however i'm not singaporean
uh what's this
my nationality is not singaporean so
oh no it's okay
even if you're a foreigner you get the discount
yah
i need to pay for that
oh really
but
yes
i think it won't cost me much
no not much
alright so before uh so after our tour uh will you what's this
will you go with us to the airport after the three-day tour
uh if you hire my services you have to pay for my services
but like i said you could uh easily find your way to the airport and just check in
yes
alright
it's well singapore is very safe you don't really need uh for a departure
alright
for a guide
because i was thinking that i will i'll be needing a tourist guide and he will show me in this place or this or that
so i can go all by myself
yes you can but of course you can also hire the services of a guide
uh hm okay i understand
alright so i think i got all the information i need
so it's nice to meet you miss jeanne is it am i right
yes euke

hello
good morning
i'm
hell
i'm participant number twenty two and my name is cris
how are you
hell hi
hi cris
good morning
my name is jeanne
oh hi jeanne
how can i help you
well jeanne i'm planning to go on a trip for three for two days in singapore
so can you help me out how to you know some places and location that might fit for us
uh did you say that it's for three people
that's right
uh can i just have your profile what is your age group
are you in your twenties
thirties or
i yes uh i have two of us is on twenties and one is el i believe it's thirteen years old
one child then more or less
yes that's right
ah okay
um what are your uh dates of travel
do you have you planned or is it open
well i'm planning by next week
i believe for it's twe march twenty nine to thirtieth
oh twenty-ninth to thirtieth uh
um hm that's right
so that's only one night you can actually stay two nights right
yes
uh mar are there thirty one days in march
you could stay till april the first
so
well i'm planning to because i have a budget only for i believe for one thousand singaporean dollars
so do you think that for up to april first is it okay
uh okay let's see
are you willing to stay uh at a budget hotel
because you have a thirteen-year-old
um hm yes
it's okay
if you're willing to stay at uh dormitories your thousand dollars will be able to accommodate all three of you
okay that's great
that means you only pay about twenty to uh maybe thirty forty dollars a room night
a room ni
but you uh the toilets would be outside you know what i mean
you are sh having shared toilets
well a uh huh
i see
well is there any hotels that accommodates with a separate commodes inside the room
uh so what you want is actually small rooms
hm with a comfort room inside
with a toilet attached huh
yes
okay
you know it's we kinda like private you know
alright
but the rooms will not be large
well it is it okay can it be fit for three people
because we want to share only for one room
wait
let me see huh
that's okay
because i am with my girlfriend and also his brother with me
so it's kinda difficult to separate our you know one child
uh you have a chaperone huh
for your girlfriend
that's right
that's right
let me just check for you
okay
well is it okay to if i may ask you in the hotels and because i want to confess for her
i want to propose to her a marriage
so do you know any places that you know that kinda romantic and at the same time unique place to propose a girl to a girl
uh yes
do you like gardens
hm sure
that's kinda good
so do you know any places with gardens you know
there is a place i know
it's called hortpark
h o r t short for horticultural
and it is a it is
uh that is in there a little uh structure that's made of trees that have been formed to look like a little very small building
and uh hortpark in fact allows you to use the rooms for a formal wedding proposal
wow
but you can use that little garden area without paying for the room if you are not using the room because you are not inviting all your friends right
yes that's right
we're only three people there
so i think there will be no charge for that
you just uh go there
you may just have to bear with maybe visitors looking at you
well it's not a problem as long as i can confess to her
oh that would be very romantic. um
ye
and the only thing is you have to uh
yes
you have to maybe bring a big umbrella in case it rains
uh when it is you know uh when you have finished proposing and it starts to rain
well i'll keep that in mind
thank you so much for that
you just tell her that in singapore we consider rain to be good fortune
oh that's good
because we all need rain don't we
yes that's right
and also i would just like to know how do i get there
that location
do i have to you know in how transportation all kind of stuff that which mean accessible at the same time fastest way to go there
you can take a bus
and uh you can reach the outside of the park
there are clear signs
and then you walk in and it's very romantic because as you walk in it's uh
the pathway just outside is called the floral walk
so you have flowers and plants
you can take a lot of photos on your way in
wow
well that's right
a o maybe i should bring my camera there so that i can
and
the uh yes
that's a good idea. uh
okay
so in our hotel that i've asked you well how much will i pay for that for until april one
until april one
i'm trying to get a fairly nice hotel
but in chinatown we do have boutique hotels that would cost you a bit more
well how much is that
okay um
i'm just trying to find you a room that can put in an extra bed for your girlfriend's brother
oh yah
well thanks so much for that
i really need it
uh the hotels yah
the hotels in chinatown tend to be rather uh small because they are converted from
restored shophouses
oh i see
well that's okay
as long as we are comfortable to sleep in well that's totally fine for me
okay
there is a very good hotel which is actually four or five-star
and the price to me it is quite reasonable
uh it's in fact a boutique hotel
it's called hotel nineteen twenty nine
it is run by a young man who loves taking old buildings and converting them
and in this one um they have a rooftop garden where you can also propose to her if you like
well that's very nice place
so how much is for one one night stay there
so because march twenty nine to april one right
so how much will it cost me
uh the
on the website it's just a little over two hundred dollars
so in all in all stay that will be the cost or
yes
uh they have a suite room
uh and it has a long bath
uh on the balcony
but i have seen it the bal the where the long bath is
it is shielded by plants
and they claimed they have done research where the tall buildings you know they overlook but they can't really see you bathing
uh so it's very unique
uh so you may call it a budget hotel but it's also known as a boutique hotel
so maybe that is the most romantic place for you
i see
let me book for that
well i'm i must see that location you told me the long bath with the you know in the outside with the mirror on it
i yes
well it's kinda unique
yes
uh do you see it on your screen
oh yes
i saw it right now
okay
i also have another titbit for you
keong saik road in my father's and grandfather's time was a red-light district
but it is all cleaned up now and that's why we have hotels there
oh that's why
so on the first day what that we'll land in singapore we want to go there
how do i go to the hotel nineteen twenty nine
okay
um let me get you the mass rapid transit map
okay
that's good
so i just want to ask in the hotel are they selling some souvenirs
souvenirs will be all around
it would be
uh you would be in chinatown
so it's very easy for you
i am getting you the map now
sure please do
i would like to see how to go there so that to avoid delays in our trip
and so since you have quite a nice hotel uh i suggest you come in by train
and use the trains and the buses to move around because many of our buses like ninety nine point nine nine are per cent are air-conditioned
almost all are air-conditioned now
uh unless the air conditioner uh breaks down
uh and some of them are double-decker buses so you're on uh upper deck you can have a very good view
well i want to check on that the bus that you told me earlier
okay
can you see the map now
yes
i can see it now
okay
can you see on the right-hand side sort of in the middle can you see changi airport at number three
yes
okay
that's where you would start taking your train ride
so what you do is when you arrived change your money at the airport
okay
and go down to the basement
there are signs leading you uh to the mrt
it's mass rapid transit
that's the name of our rail system
so there you approach the officer and buy a ez-link ticket
ez-link ticket
wha yes
that will allow you to use the buses and trains and you also get a discount. uh ins
and you also get a discount. uh ins and if you use cash it's a bit more expensive
hm i see
because uh after you stored value when you return they charge you a small fee for the manufacture of the card but you get your refund back of the unused portion
wow
that's good
so probably i will just buy the ez-link one
yes
that's right
you buy for all three of you
yes
you will have to buy adult tickets because the thirteen-year-old is not a student in singapore
he's not a young child
he is not you know if he's six or seven you can get a child ticket but he has to get adult ticket
so you take your green line and you follow it down to city hall
city hall
yes
city hall is uh one of the interchange stations and you if you like uh on another day you can get off there and have a look around there
but otherwise you continue down to no let me see
yes
you get off at city hall and you switch to the red line to dhoby ghaut
can you see dhoby ghaut at number eight
yes
so is this a train station also
yes
uh dhoby ghaut is where three lines meet
can you see
uh huh yes i saw i see it
so it's also yah
it's also a very big shopping centre uh with restaurants cafes
a little garden nearby as well
so at dhoby ghaut you will just take two stops down to chinatown
uh okay
i see
okay
i get it now
so how many hours should i it will take to go to chinatown
approximi or you know just as estimation
e it's very fast on the trains
uh maybe forty minutes considering you come in at non peak hours where you wait two minutes more for the train
uh that's okay
it's a very reasonable time
uh that's fine with me as long as we can go to chinatown and you know take some rest
and you are not staying too many days so you just carry a backpack or you know small luggage you can
yes
as you walk to your hotel you can look around at the shops in chinatown places you might want to come back to eat to shop
so i just want to ask in chinatown what is the most popular restaurant there which is affordable
uh affordable but you want to bring your girlfriend there right
yah that's right
uh just you know want to sightseeing and also want to eat something different
do you mind chinese food
that's okay
this is a very special chinese food
uh it's right in the heart of chinatown and the restaurant is called lee kui uh (ah hoi)
lee kui
uh it's in a street called mosque street
mosque street um hm
i'm trying to see if they have it on the website otherwise i can tell you i have a brochure here which makes me want to go there to eat tonight
oh lee kui (ah hoi)
okay
so what is their specialty in ter in regards to the chinese food
uh okay
they ha this is a dialect cuisine called teochew
and we have uh crab
uh we also have uh it's the crab is cold crab
are you familiar with cold crab
huh
actually no what kind of that what kind of dish is that
uh it
i uh it's a special dialect kind of food
the cold crab is tasty
people are used to chili crab
but if you don't like chili this is a little bit uh closer to not hurting your taste buds
uh it has got gravy to go with it as well
uh except that the cold crab is in fact raw
but it is soaked in vinegar
i don't know if you like vinegar
i love vinegar so i like this dish
well the counterpart of that is this spicy crab
so is it cooked or is it raw
well no that one is cooked
and you have a lot of chili in it
well i prefer it to be cooked
that one it should be cooked. rather than
that one it should be cooked. rather than you know i don't want to upset my stomach
okay
alright then
uh there is also something called jelly pork
uh the pork you know when you cook you get these gravies that form a jelly
and it's very tasty
so it's almost like you're eating a dessert that is savoury in taste
oh that's good
it's kinda unique
well i must try that
well is it affordable for you know for uh three people
three people um maybe seventy dollars i would think
it depends on how big is your appetite how much you order
how
okay
i just must taken out of that in terms of budgeting
uh they have also something like deep fried pork and liver roll
and uh yam paste
uh yam paste is quite a sweet dessert
the yam is cooked uh that would be the ending of your meal
so if you have eaten too much you can skip the dessert
aw
well my girlfriend e loves sweet you know you have she has a sweet tongue so i must try that yam paste that you told me
yes that
so i'll just put a note on that
yah
that would be quite nice
i think it's a little bit like a filipino type of dessert
it's uh sweet and it's sticky you know
hm yes
my girlfriend loves that so probably we will buy that also
and also since we are in chinatown do you know any places there a place there that we can bought souvenirs you know kinda like t-shirts
yes
all over
when you walk out of your hotel and you walk down the main road you will find that there are lots of little streets leading off the main road that is called north bridge road
and they have stalls set up along the road so you can check out the stalls
well i rather to prepare myself to saw to see that
ha uh t-shirts are just a few dollars
uh they are not the high end sort
and you can also buy souvenirs like ten dollars for three souvenirs
alright
and they would be all different kinds different colours
okay
so i wa
there's a place also that i want to go in
it's in universal studio
so do you know how to go there
universal studios yes
let me get you the mrt map again
well
okay
well thank you for the restaurants and the hotel
you help me a lot that in that time
well all along the same street there are other restaurants
so you can just you know walk through and have a look
and quite often in chinatown they display their menu outside so you can gauge what the actual prices of the food you are going to eat will cost
what i'm giving you is just an estimate
okay
well that's okay
i'll just keep that in mind also you know because this is my first time to book i to trip for you know overseas
just kinda nervous about this so i just want to check out my budget so that we can go you know
okay so where is the
okay
uh let me show you
uh are you hearing me
yes
okay
let me show you first from your hotel in chinatown to go to the place i recommended for you to do your proposal if you don't want to do it at the rooftop of your hotel okay uh
yah
yes sure
please do
so you take the um line the blue line right down to harbourfront
can you see that
yes
and here is the start of the north east line
so you switch you go to the circle line which is the yellow line
and you move along to just one stop in fact
uh one or two stops it doesn't make a difference
either telok blangah or labrador you get off uh the bus uh get off the train and you get on to a bus
uh when you reached the bus stop at the back there will be signs to tell you the buses that stops there and the route it's going
so you have to look for one that says alexandra road and hortpark
uh huh
okay
alexandra road
yes and hortpark
which is just one street down
so the bus will make a turn and it will drop you almost in front in fact it is in front of this garden that i'm telling you about
uh huh
okay
that's nice
well i'm just asking that uh in advance because i want to go there with her by before april first since i believe in march thirty first we're going there so that i can propose to her
yah
yes
very good
uh that will be a very nice romantic setting
and it shouldn't be too crowded
uh it will give you a little bit of privacy
you just need to bring maybe if you want to bring snacks or something uh you can have a little picnic
if you walk into the garden there are sheltered areas there
and bring your camera you can take lots of photos
i see
so we're allowed to bring food inside the park
yes you are
you just need to bring a plastic bag to make sure you collect all your leftover uh crackers or cups and then you dispose them in the proper bins
okay
so thank you so much for that for giving me the direction to go to the place i want to propose to my girlfriend
so i want to know also before you know the proposal
we want to go to sentosa and also to universal studios singapore
so can you please help me out how to go to universal's first
okay
you see the same blue line from chinatown
so this time you take it to harbourfront but you walk to the bus terminals uh which is uh just nearby
and you will also pass a food centre so you might want to check out some of the local foods there
we have a lot of uh muslim food and we also have my favourite fish soup stall there in the middle of the food centre
but if you're in a hurry then you just go just behind the food centre a few steps away to the bus bay right at the corner next to the mrt station and you board a shuttle bus that goes into sentosa directly
uh huh
okay
uh you can also cross the road and take the light rail but i think this way it's much easier
so okay
i'll just keep on mind what you tell me earlier
so probably i will just go to the route that you've given me so to avoid delays
yes that's right
so also i would like to ask how much the entrance fee for the sentosa
uh sentosa itself is only two dollars to enter
and one dollar for your bus ride
and when you come out uh you are not given tickets when you come out it's free of charge to take the buses out
uh huh
uh huh
aw that's great
now i'm showing you universal studios now
wow
the lorax
uh i want to watch that also but hm skip that part
so is there an entrance fee to go on to universal studio
yes
there is an entrance fee
uh you can buy a package
sometimes they have uh during certain promotions they give you special prices
but yah um you are not coming on a public holiday right
it's not the easter weekend
wow
yes
it's an easter weekend so
it is the easter weekend
it's april first mar yes
i believe so
it is
um can you see the prices there
uh huh
i suggest you budget at these prices first
uh huh
uh at the highest so that you you know it will cost you seventy four dollars uh each for you and your girlfriend and oh actually for all three of you
so it's
uh huh
uh huh
well uh so i will say it's kinda one hundred plus singaporean dollars
well it's kinda you know it's not expensive
two hundred
two hundred
it's two hundred and twenty two
uh that's okay
i believe it's on the budget
yes
it's all still on the budget
and if you want to eat in chinatown at the food centre's uh street side it's very cheap
it's under ten dollars for each of you
okay
uh noodles would be about four dollars rice for five dollars the most
oh that's cool. so el
oh that's cool. so el
you know what
i want to take a picture in front of the you know universal studio globe with the fountain and i don't know if it's in the centre but i want to take a picture there with them
you can you will take lots of pictures in this area
it's very pretty
uh not only within universal studios but on the island as well
okay
so do you know how long uh can you estimate how long can we vis you know check out the sentosa park
how many hours can we see all of the sights there
uh do you notice they have a two-day package and a three-day package
so if you were to visit all the attractions one day is not enough
oh probably we will just go into one day only
i just want to just you know just check out some best features in there so and at the same time we're going to universal studio
that's right. i
that's right. i
and i suggest you skip the casino
no don't worry
i don't gamble
i don't like gambling
although for you as a tourist to enter it is free of charge to enter to gamble
you could enter just to have a look and then come out again
well i keep my mind on that
actually that's my first time to see a casino also
you might want to propose to your girlfriend first because a visit to sentosa uh may tire her for the next day
so uh propose to her and then the second day you can bring her to universal studios
okay
that's good
so probably i'll just change my schedules in terms of proposing to her
yah
that's right
and you'd be very happy after you get your yes answer
yes
that's right
definitely
what else do you think uh you would like to do in singapore
well i know there's a you told in the service guide that i saw in a brochure here in the philippines
i just want to ask where to go to the merlion statue
okay
the merlion statue uh let me get on to the mrt map for you
please do
because i want to see that also
okay
so say you're at your hotel here in chinatown
you go down to the green line and then you switch east bound to city hall
uh huh
east bound
okay
and you get off there
that's a very interesting historic area
uh before you go to the merlion you will be passing by our supreme court and city hall
uh although they are now right now being uh renovated to be turned into the singapore uh art museum oh sorry the singapore a big museum for singaporeans to enjoy
both of them would be combined
um you can walk from there towards the seaward side and uh you would be able to see the merlion
you walk across a big field across from where they are renovating these two buildings
oh uh huh
okay
so uh huh
and you get to see views uh of the hotel marina bay sands
very scenic
i see
i believe that you told me earlier that the merlion is a historical place
so is there any places that you know there's an history on it
and uh you know
say again please
there is an historical places that we can go
another places ins uh besides the merlion
are you thinking of ethnic areas uh also
yes
that's okay
okay
besides chinatown well for history first by the river that's very historic place because uh where the merlion is uh nearby is the start of the mouth of the singapore river
and that's where sir stamford raffles landed which he's a british who came here to look for a trading port
so and the whole riverside the buildings have been conserved
so it's an interesting walk huh
uh you could walk in fact along the river or you could from your hotel in chinatown take the line to little india and soak in some indian culture in that area
uh huh
i see
okay
i i must see it also
it's ki i believe it's kinda few blocks or it will just take another minutes or is it to take to little india it will take for me a one hour or
i
to little india uh usually two stops about 5 minutes
but on this line
so maybe seven or eight minutes but uh you have to factor in walking down to the station in getting out so maybe twenty minutes
oh well that's okay
it's kinda it's kinda short distance
so probably we'll go there first before to the merlion since it's near in the chinatown
is that correct
yes that's right
uh you go there uh try and go there in the morning where many people are marketing
you can take photos of the flower garland makers the uh vegetable sellers and visit the hindu temples before twelve o'clock
because they yah they close around twelve to about four o'clock and then they reopen
but if you missed it you can go back later in the uh around four something
and it is open till nine o'clock
and you can eat there also since you say you like chili
i see
before twelve hm
oh i see
uh huh
yes
i like chili but my girlfriends love sweets
so you know kinda contradicting
uh but in the uh little india has lots of sweets also milk-based sweets in the same area
you can both be very happy
well that's good to hear
so probably we'll just gonna eat there also together with his brother
e there is also dessert stall in chinatown uh that specialises in uh pureed sesame paste and pureed peanut paste
uh just about one street away from where you are
uh huh
okay
so i would just like to know if there is any beach that kinda near to chinatown so that we can you know stroll walk on the seashore
the area where the merlion is is actually where we have the seafront
uh but the seafront that you see is now a reservoir to collect rainwater that falls in the city area and also to prevent flooding
uh if you want to walk i think on men sentosa uh after you visit universal studios take a walk along the beach that would be better
uh huh
uh okay
uh huh
yes
okay
thank you so much for that
and also about the because you told me that
so i guess is there any historical places that you know is available to see
historical places
if you want uh what sort of history do you want
war history or do you want to see a museum about uh local lifestyle
well maybe a local lifestyle first a cultural type
okay
okay that is very um convenient because right in chinatown we have the chinatown heritage uh centre which shows you life in a building like yours but in its original form
so it's called the chinatown heritage centre and it's right where you are you just walk two streets down
uh huh
i see
that's very convenient
thank you so much for that
and also about the war history where is the location of it
the museum of the war history
uh the museum is accessible by bus and by train
it's called the changi prison museum or changi museum
you take the west line uh right down to like just hold on a minute
okay
you can actually go by bus all the way number two bus
and you can have sight see along the way
but uh if you prefer to go there faster you take a train uh to tanah merah
uh huh
tanah merah
okay
i'll just
uh huh
sorry
yah tanah merah
and then you switch to number two bus
uh huh
number two bus
and you are right outside the museum
i just want to ask
is it okay to use my ez-link ticket to the train
when you'd when i would i see
yes
that's what you're buying it for for the trains and buses and the buses
i okay
i get it now
uh huh
uh because i
so you don't worry about uh carrying loose change on knowing how much you know
so fix your problem
uh huh
uh huh
okay
that's good
okay that's very helpful
so is there any you know places that you might you know sightseeing places that you can give us or recommend us wha a best place that we can you know stroll alo around take pictures
uh to stroll around and take pictures would be the areas i have recommended
uh huh
if you want uh garden do you like gardens uh besides hortpark
also
we have another garden that is very famous and older one
and from harbourfront you take the yellow line all the way to botanic gardens
uh huh
aw
that's also quite romantic for proposal but it would be busier
i think there will be more people around and uh
that's right
it's also more of uh open space whereas if you reached hortpark and it's raining they have a big covered area near the entrance where you can wait out the rain and you can walk to this place where i said you can propose to your girlfriend
okay that's good
so i think that's okay now
well can you recommend other places besides what i'm asking
you know any location that we might visited visiting now
you
i another part of history that you might like to visit it is uh a museum that is near to the city hall stop
uh huh
and it's also near the merlion and it's called the asian civilisation's museum
so it gives you not only the history of singapore but of uh well we have artefacts from india from china and also from the middle east
uh huh
that's cool
well that's very good to hear
so in that same place near the merlion there's a various museum that i can go in take some pictures
is it allowed to take a picture inside the museum
uh not inside the museum because you know when you have your camera flash on it's uh it fades the photograph uh the exhibits
and i maybe for security also they usually do not allow photography inside
uh huh
i see
i get it now
so probably i'll just take a picture outside of it
yes
uh inside if you want to see the history of singapore only uh there is a foyer on the upstairs level you can take the lift or walk up the stairs
and that's free of charge
okay
so i believe that you helped me a lot in here
well thank you so much for it
i'll just put to notes on everything that you told me
and probably by the next day or so we're gonna book and go to singapore
well thank you so much for that and you really helped me a lot
you are most welcome
uh do you need anything else
uh maybe you want to go to a church or anything else
well i believe that's enough
well probably i will just try to call back to check if there's anything e
okay
because in that area we also have an anglican church catholic churches
uh when you get off at city hall they are all within walking distance of that area
uh huh
i see
sure
okay
so i'm a christian. there
so i'm a christian. there is there any christian church there
uh what sort of a christian are you
i'm a in the philippines it's a born again christian
do you have any
born again christian
uh i'm not so familiar with uh
oh i see
so well that's okay
probably i will just visit the evangelic is that correct
wha yes evangelist
we have new creation church and new life church
but i'm not so good with uh
i'm sorry for a uh religion
yah
well that's okay
so is it okay to take a pictures inside the churches
uh i am not sure about the protestant churches but uh in the catholic churches they allow you
and the catholic and anglican churches have lots of statues inside you know of their saints
uh let me show you a picture of one of them
okay
please do
you know why i keep asking for souvenirs
because each place that i want to go becau just i want to buy something there so that reminds me that we went there and take pictures you know
oh is that the saint andrews
yes saint andrews
this is a church of england anglican church
oh it's great
so beautiful
it's a yah
it's a national monument
and we also have a bit of war history on the walls
uh because uh during the war the british were here and some died and so people put up plaques in church to remember them
uh huh
okay
it's good to see
i'm fascinated with the infrastructure you know how they build it
it's just like a medieval time
yes
uh it is in fact shaped like a cross if you are in a helicopter above it
i see
and it's a very active church. they
and it's a very active church. they in fact they have a little sunken area nearby
because they cannot expand the church because it's a protected building
so there is a sunken area on the other side of the building where they have uh they use for other purposes when they have not enough space within the church
okay
so besides to that saint andrews church cathedral do you have any loca different location other churches that is available
uh the catholic churches are just within walking distance across the road from there
and they were all built in the eighteen hundreds early nineteen hundreds
so they are a bit like this
in fact more on it because you know catholics have lots of statues of saints
and the way of the cross along the walls so it's great for photography
the priest will allow it
uh huh
wow
yah
i really must bring my camera there
so i just want to ask since um in chinatown i want to know how to get there in saint andrews
and you know take pictures in it
oh you just take the uh line to city hall station
uh huh
and when you get off i believe there's even a sign to tell you where this building is
oh that's great
yah
so maybe at the first day of our trip maybe i should go there first
and besides the churches well at night is there any li bars you know besides in chinatown is there any locations that accommodates a you know bars night bars you know kind night market
do you have a night market in singapore that we might
the night market would be in chinatown but the bars i would suggest along the singapore river
uh you just walk along the river
there are many uh restaurants and some are just you know sports bars where they watch uh games
there's a huge tv screen and you can watch international matches
and then uh some of them are supported by certain people who like certain teams
and they go and cheer their team on
although that is not held in singapore
so there's a great atmosphere there
i would suggest along the singapore river
uh huh
i see
sure
and i want to know also is there any bars that affordable
you know what i mean
that the
again as i said the prices there are quite competitive because there are so many of them
so you can just walk along and uh you can in fact ask the prices before you go in
uh in fact some of them they just put up a sign to say uh so many dollars for a jug of beer
uh ten of fifteen dollars because they want to show that they are not expensive
uh huh
uh huh
oh that's good
there's they even have a promotions in bars so that's great
yes
uh so you know because people like you have the same idea that it looks expensive
because expatriate community are also seen there
yes hm
but it's not actually
uh there is one bar i like there
it's called uh penny black
you know the first stamp in the world is called the penny black
penny black
oh i ju
and uh it's at the start of the river
uh you can also eat there if you like
they have got very good fish and chips if you uh don't mind eating that. not very singaporean
eating that. not very singaporean
i go on
so this is the different various bars and restaurants that
yes
okay
can you see on your screen the three quays we have along the river
uh huh
so boat quay is at the start of the river
yes
oh okay
and the penny black is there right at the start
it's quite an old bar
and you find lots of people there
it's affordable
it's not expensive
and then
oh that's good
and at clarke quay uh lots of places to eat
uh retail shops
uh at clarke quay you get many retail shops besides the bars and the restaurants
this is just like a food court and shopping centre is that correct
the clarke quay
an no not at clarke quay
clarke quay is a bit more upscale than a food court
ah okay
okay
i just
if you
if you want a market go to maxwell market in chinatown
aw
okay thank you
there the food will cost only about three to five dollars a dish depending on uh what is inside the dish
okay
and clarke quay is and boat quay we also have robertson quay
these places are best visited in the evenings
i must see that also
i know i believe the twenty nine thirty thirty one i believe for four days only and it's kinda hard to visit all the locations here
but i must put my itinerary or my time here
so that's good
robertson's quay
so this is all besides the shore
is that correct
uh along the river
along the river
okay
i'm sorry for that
i so from the merlion you go to boat quay first
and then you go to clarke quay
uh huh
and robertson quay is the last quay there
it's more laid back
it's a little bit quieter here at robertson quay
oh okay
okay
that's good
so i would like to know since we're going on a travel
we're getting exhausted
is there any spas that we can stay and get pampered
yes
in chinatown there are spas to in fact sometimes they will stop you as you are walking and give you a pamphlet to say we have a special offer today.
uh normal price is about uh ninety eight dollars for one hour
uh full body massage but sometimes they will offer it first time trial for thirty eight dollars
i believe that's enough for i think that's uh affordable with my budget because you know we're just going stroll around in the loca different location that you just told me
so probably the main problem the main thing that we need is the food
so you've given me a lot of that
and is there anything else that we can visit besides the quay parks in the robertson quay you know
is there any locations that you know we can go visit
uh you can just walk by yourself to visit the hindu temples in little india
in chinatown we have a fairly new temple called the buddha tooth relic temple
and the oldest temple which is one street away called teluk at teluk ayer street is called um thian hock keng temple
and it's within walking distance from where you are
well the hotel that i book is probably the most nicest place because you know i can go to the little india without even bothering where should i go
and is there any malls that we can you know can visit
are you talking about shopping malls
one of the yes
one of the famous just you know just want to look at also
there are very many famous malls in singapore but
well just recome but for me just recommend what you know
because you know this is my first time to go in there
so probably the best thing is you just recommend me and have a look and s maybe later i will search for it
is that okay
okay um
okay um
sorry
as you are going to sentosa uh just before you come back if you take the light rail instead of the bus out it's only a small fee two dollars also i think
you get off at vivo city
it's spelt v i v o city
and it's a huge shopping mall
so wait what you see on the screen is the buddha tooth relic temple and museum which is walking distance from your hotel
okay
v i um hm

and it is near in our hotel right
yes
you just walk there
so you buy your souvenirs and you end up at a uh temple and the museum
uh now you want to have do you want to see the other temple
i show it to you
the thian hock keng temple
so
uh huh
this is you see this temple is a bit new
the other temple is uh two streets away
but you really should walk there because that's the nearest place
and you can see uh the oldest or well one of the oldest temples in singapore
uh huh
okay

well i'll just keep the notes from everything that you've given me
and i would like to thank you for this because i believe that my budget for staying there is enough for to accommodate to everything that you the location that i might visit
