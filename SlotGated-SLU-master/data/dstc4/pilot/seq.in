hi good afternoon
this is tour guide my name is lynnette and who am i speaking to
hi this is participant number thirty one
and my name is aaki that's double a k i
okay
hi aaki
hello miss lynnette
and how may i okay i'm fine
and how may i help you today
how are you doing
well um i'm planning to bi visit singapore in the near future
well i don't have the specific date as of the moment but i really but i'm planning of visiting the country
and if i'm not mistaken you're a great and good tourist guide
so can you help me with this tour
sure
if you are talking about this uh year uh we have a period of time that coming up really soon end of may and december because then we have this great singapore sale
so almost all the shops in singapore are having good discounts uh for their shopping
so that maybe one time that you'd like to consider
the other period of time where we do have big celebration in singapore would be uh hari raya uh puasa
so one month before uh the date in august uh we do light up the street in kampong glam as well as geylang serai
uh and you will find a lot of food that specially prepared to welcome hari raya puasa um being uh on sale at these two location
so that is one other uh month that you want to consider coming to singapore
the other month would be in november and that's where the indians get to celebrate deepavali and we light up serangoon road
so uh these ro few roads that i mentioned uh will gives you very good uh photo opportunities because the streets are beautifully decorated uh to remember or to celebrate these special days
and of course in december we light up the whole street of orchard road right up to the marina area and again with a christmas theme
so different months for you to choose
so again depending on uh what would you like and whether it fits into your schedule
so um most of these months is perfectly fine to come to singapore
but if you can't fit in your schedule in those months then you can always uh do it any other time uh that you like
okay
okay
uh hm well it sounded like your country is a busy country there
but uh let me just clarify this what do you mean by hari raya
what is that supposed to mean
okay yah
okay
hari raya is a festival that celebrated by the malays here
um now in uh before hari raya the muslims would do um a puasa that means they do not eat from uh yes from uh early morning uh from dawn to dusk alright
so uh after the uh evening period that's they can eat until day break again
so after this uh month of fasting or we called it puasa uh the muslim will celebrate with this major festival called hari raya
so
uh so that is for the muslim itself
yes
ah okay
uh malay
yah
so these are festivals celebrated by the malay people
so in order to celebrate this festival they will dress up their houses clean up their houses
not that they don't clean the houses but they do very thorough cleaning of their houses as well as uh prepare their house for a visits by their relatives and friends
so they would buy a food like for example special cookies that they may not eat for the rest of the year but specially made for the hari raya so that their friends uh and relatives when they visit them can get to taste all the um yummy cookies and food
okay
um yah
well that's cool but uh yah sorry about that
but that's cool to know
uh but do they have any kind of a special cuisine or in that festival are they allowed to eat
yes
the uh muslims will only do fasting before hari raya puasa alright
now once the they have uh completed their one month fasting uh they will celebrate hari raya
yes and of course they do uh eat their normal meals
and i'm not saying that they don't eat during the fasting season i'm just saying that from day break to dusk they do not eat or drink
but after they break their fast everyday uh in the evening usually at about seven plus in the evening
uh five plus seven plus depending on the uh moon uh they will be able to eat
and once day break they will uh start to fast their fast again
okay
oh okay
and so if that celebration is celebrated during october right
uh august
uh august sorry
thank you for that
did that celebration is for august so meaning to say that is a general or a public holiday in singapore correct
yes
yes the hari raya puasa is a public holiday in singapore
uh hm so it's a non-working holidays for you all guys
uh no for the guides will be business as usual
uh okay business as usual
okay that's good
but uh you did you told me something about the indians in november
okay
in november the uh indians another race in singapore will be celebrating a major festival called deepavali and this is a festival of light
um again same thing before the preparations for this festivals uh the indians do not fast
alright they don't have like uh a fixed time for fasting
so uh they will start to prepare for this big celebration uh by yearly thoroughly cleaning their houses uh making new curtains making new cushions buying new clothes for everyone to wear and of course again food plays a very important part in all our festivals
so again preparing food uh sweets uh for their guests to enjoy when their guests friends and relatives visit them during uh the deepavali season
um hm the which is the festival of light
and you just told me that they are preparing some or they are buying some new clothes right
are uh is that for a costume or something like that
well uh the traditional clothes for the indians because the indians come from the southern part of singapore
uh yes so the southern indians would be wearing um uh sari
alright with it's a piece of cloth five point five metre without any zips or button uh and it's a matter of folding the cloth
uh it can come in any kind of materials from cotton right up to silk and the ladies would wear them with a short blouse
so that would be the traditional costume for the south indian ladies
but uh a lot of the ladies here they do wear the north indian ladies they wear this uh salwar kameez which is uh consist of a long blouse and long pants uh with a scarf
so yes that is also a traditional kind of a costume
uh but yes it is still uh a normal every day kind of a dressing for our malay la uh for our indian ladies here
uh but otherwise most of the other time i would think that because of the uh western uh modern influences well the indian ladies today would also be wearing the normal kind of uh clothes that any other lady in the world would be wearing alright the modern kind of dressing
okay
oh so oh that's good
and how about the you how about the sari
the yah the sari
you just told me about the sari what kind of cloth is that
i mean is that for the head i mean for the whole body
what does it can do
okay
for the sari it's actually a piece of material that is five point five metre long alright
oh so that is for the male indians
uh no it's for the ladies
oh it's for the ladies
sorry i'm kind of mixed here
and can you the people or in the indian the people have lot of uh what do you call this
dresses
sorry
will that
costumes
no you are talking about sari right
yes sari
okay sari is uh worn uh by the ladies
the guys
and how about for the boys
okay
the guys will be wearing um quite similar to what the uh malay guys are wearing
it will be uh like a blo uh a shirt with uh long pants
okay long pants
is it possible that you can show me the image and so that i could really get the idea of the dresses the womens are wearing and for the boys also if that is okay
okay
sure no problem
okay let me just
and
yes
uh okay
so miss lynnette so as of the moment since i if i'm not mistaken you are searching for sari looks right
yes
okay
so how about for the december you you told me just a is there a kind of park there is the marina bay
uh park
no park as in an amusement park for everybody where in lovers and you know family can get together to celebrate the fun of christmas
oh yes uh okay now yes the image for the sari this is quite a modern uh yah version of the sari
you can see now on the screen
okay let me just go
the uh
it's okay don't worry
okay
yes
you can see all these beautiful ladies wearing the traditional sari alright
and that's one okay
yes i see that one now
hm so they look very beautiful right
yes and the model is very beautiful too
very colourful
yah very colourful sari
it's a piece of uh cloth like i mentioned uh there is no ti uh and there's no zip or buttons on the sari the bottom part the skirt
so it's a matter of wrapping uh around the waist
yah and the ladies
so it's just wrapping
it's like wrapping okay
yah
and the ladies wear them with a short uh blouse
yes so you see um this
so did they use that for celebration of for the deepavali
uh sorry
they use that clothes for the celebration of deepavali right
uh well i wouldn't say they use these clothes but if you're talking about the wearing a traditional costume yes
uh quite a lot of our indian ladies today they would still try to wear traditional clothings especially when it comes to um uh major festivals uh like uh for example uh the deepavali
yes they do try and wear uh this kind of uh costume
well that's great
but i'm really curious about this deepavali thing
you just told me that it is a festival of light right
yes
so meaning to say they as in do they have a fireworks or it's like a showing of lights different kind of lights
is that is how would you describe deepavali in like for an image something like that
well uh deepavali is actually called the festival of light it's because uh the indians in their home they would like to light this um incense and uh a candle uh in this incense uh candle holder in their home
and basically in short it's actually a festival to celebrate the triumph of good over evil
uh so this is all this festival is all about
yes
oh i see
okay now i get the idea
i thought they will just use the like firecrackers and stuff like that
so meaning to say they are just gonna light their houses with candle and scented candles right
uh up to the individual whether they want to use a scented or just a normal uh kind of uh candle
alright
oh yah
okay
so how so let's go back with the men dress for the deepavali
let me see what they wear
yes
alright
uh it's quite a simple clothing
okay
after
so how do you call the men's costume or let's say natural dress or normal dress for the men
uh no uh special uh well we can call it
for indian
special name
yah
kurta
kurta k u r t a
kurta
kurta
yah
wow
kurta
kurta um
kurta
yah
oh kurta
how do you say kurta right
kurta
kurta yah
kurta
yah
oh did i say it right kurta
yah
yay
so most of the indian people or the indian guys what they usually use for language
as in they are tamil or what
uh for the indians in singapore uh well i would say that majority of them would be uh third generation singaporeans already
so uh even i think in their own home they would be speaking english but uh a lot of the ancestors the indian ancestors would come from uh southern part of india uh so yes they would be speaking tamil
oh so that is their mother tongue right
yes the mother tongue for the indians uh in singapore generally uh tamil uh unless they come from the northern part of singapore then they would be speaking hindi
but incident
wow
yes
okay
sorry
but inci
sorry go
okay
incidentally uh tamil is one of our official languages out here in singapore
oh okay so kurta
so is there a kurta dress for the men
uh we don't say dress uh kurta is fine
ah okay
yah
ah okay kurta
okay
yah
so they do have that kind of celebration for the deepavali like party at night
or something like eating festival
what do they usually do
uh in just instead for just lighting the candles for their houses
is there anything special
well uh yes
the indians would visit uh their relatives and friends and of course they get to uh eat
like i said the families would be busy cooking uh uh to make sure when their friends and relatives come and visit they would have food available for them
so um they will be cooking things like curry different kind of uh flavour of curry
uh eating this curry with rice or with um uh bread like uh chapatti that's made from wheat flour or roti prata
uh may but it maybe a little bit difficult to make this at home uh or naan alright
naan is uh of course the indian bread
and the
okay.2 okay
uh okay
yah
nice
so these are uh some of the foods that the indians uh would be preparing
uh and of course a lot of homes they tends to make their own uh so-called uh sauces uh and we call them masalas
so they can make from coconut uh they can make from beans yellow beans lentil
uh they can make them from uh vegetables as well as spinach
alright
so these are some of the dishes and food that the indians would prepare to welcome their friends and relative
as to partying yah i think some of the younger people yes they may go out partying in the various clubs that we have in singapore
uh so but i think for deepavali the majority of the time they would like to spent time with their family uh and visiting one another
um hm
uh hm
well that's good
and another thing i want to know since you're talking about food i want to know what would be the specialty or the special food that the indian people prepare for this deepavali celebration
uh okay
i uh mentioned that actually all the time they would be eating uh a lot of this bread like roti prata chapatti naan with curry
so again this is one food that they will uh be uh having that a lot of them also like to eat this food called uh tandoori
okay i'm gonna show you some uh uh show you a picture of this tandoori
it is a chicken that is cooked with a spice alright
and a red colour uh colouring
so that is the tandoori
yes
yes
is oh is that rice
is that fried rice or java rice
uh it can be a plain rice
uh i'm talking about the chicken huh
so th
uh the chicken
yah
so this is uh usually it's quite red in colour the tandoori uh chicken
okay
yah
is that a special kind of chicken
uh not special it's the way that it's cooked uh that is special
they put this chicken um and cook them in uh this big uh kind of a clay pot uh
so that is
some seasoning like pepper and salt something like that
uh hm
yah
yes
yes
uh okay that's good
uh okay hold on
i'll get another recipe out here
let see
so most of the people there like celebrating the deepavali prepare those foods right
yah
yes
oh well that's good
then it's kinda tasty
i want to taste it now
but if they do um yah but you see uh if they do not have time they can always buy them uh from the hote uh from the restaurants or buy them from cafes
uh so these are just very i would say typical uh indian dishes that indians would prepare either at home or they buy them uh from the uh restaurant
wow
so
now and the indians yes they do eat uh a lot of this food
they eat uh basmati rice which is the longer kind of rice grain
yah
so they would be uh eating this rather from uh rather than rice that comes from thailand alright which is the shorter rice grain
so this is the kind of uh just some examples of uh indian food that we have okay
and then of course um a lot of families do prepare masalas
uh like i said those are sauces and they come in like white colour green colour orange colour because they are made from different kind of ingredients
the yellow colour masalas would be made from beans
yes
wow it's kind well i'm starving i want to eat
yes
no just kidding
so thank you very much for that information miss lynnette about the deepavali
i gain so much information about that
but let's move on with the december occasion that you will be having
what would that be again
yes
uh this will be the celebration for christmas
well in singapore whatever races or uh belief uh that we come from uh everybody else i think celebrate christmas here in singapore because the streets in orchard road uh will be lighted up very beautifully
so i'm just going to show you uh last year uh the light up on orchard road
okay
okay
okay
so for example i'm in singapore and i wanted to see that christmas celebration in orchard road what would be the ideal transportation i would use
well you can walk
wow
really
from the airport
yah
uh no not from the airport alright
okay
uh what i meant by walking is well you can stay anywhere in singapore
so you just go the orchard road and
okay
so is it orchard road is like the main city of singapore
or
i wouldn't say the uh main city
uh it is like the main uh shopping belt in singapore
so uh now you have this image of last year the whole street of orchard road is lighted up
so that's why i say you walk and you um enjoy the lights and lots of bus uh photo opportunities
alright beautiful lightings because every year the lights are uh different
the decorations on the buildings on orchard road because every other building on orchard road is either a hotel or a shopping complex
so uh they are also nicely decorated for christmas so of course with
wow
wow
ah okay
so that means everybody participates in this particular occasion
yes that's good that's
if you mean participate by coming down to orchard road do a little bit of shopping and uh soaking in the atmosphere uh and taking photograph then yes
yes
wow
yah
uh that then that is participation
wow that's great
well that's great
i'm happy
i'm really excited to see singapore this december if necessary
yes it's very pretty in the month of december
what are the other events which is happening in december rather than in orchard road
uh i mean do they have like musicality show like party in the streets or they do have drinking occasions something like that
uh yes we do have
uh on the christmas day uh christmas eve we what we do is you see now a lot of cars on the street
yes
i am
what we do is we close this street
yes i'm
no way
yes
so and uh yes we have a street party out here
alright
inside just
wow
so up until what time
it starts from what time to till what time
eight p.m
eight p.m
eight p.m. until uh twelve midnight
uh in fact we just close this street uh just over the last weekend
we had the fashion uh step out uh fashion
so we have the longest runway alright
the models are modelling on the street
okay so well something this is the first time that we are doing it fashion step out
wow
nice that's good
okay yah
so what you mean is the orchard road is the busiest road or place in the singapore am i correct
or just one particular place
uh no orchard road is one uh long street of shopping uh opportunities
um so what do you mean by long
as in long
how big this how long
i mean what would be the square metres
no i'm just kidding you mean
so okay
orchard road itself is about uh three kilometres long
so every other building would be a shopping mall or hotel
wow
wow so that is the nice place to stay in
what would be the
what kind of hotels would i see in orchard road
i mean are there like three star hotel from three star to five star like that
in fact okay
we don't have uh three star hotel in orchard road we do have four star
uh just about ten minutes walk we have this hotel called elizabeth hotel
elizabeth
yah
it's a small hotel
okay let me just show you
how do it look like
ah okay thanks for that
okay so if ever i go there in singapore i'm gonna look for that
yah
this is
so what would ki what would be the let say what would be the ideal hotel for me to stay
let say for me to tour in singapore i only have one thousand singapore dollar what would be the ideal hotel for me to stay in orchard road
okay you can choose this hotel
the rates wise for this hotel is approximately about two hundred and fifty dollars this is one option
uh because you're if you're going to just stay a short uh stay in singapore uh no problem alright
so you can stay in this hotel
uh the other hotel just next door to this hotel is this hotel called york hotel
because uh i'm just uh choosing some hotels just very close to orchard road since you know i think you may decide to come in the month of uh december
so you know you just walk down to the are the street that is all lighted up okay to visit york hotel
the charges approximately uh two hundred and eighty dollars per room per night
so this is another option
uh otherwise you could stay in this hotel called grand park hotel city hall
yes
hotel
uh hm
you could also choose to stay here as well
yes
so what would be the differences between these hotels like the three hotels that you shown me
that you are showing me
differences as in location
differences like differences like amenities
okay
uh all the three hotels they have full amenities so they have breakfast available in the morning
uh they have uh um cafes in the hotel
so if you don't want to eat out you can always eat inside the hotel
you could have room service as well in these three hotels
now if you want a little bit more affordable you can stay in this hotel called um grand central
okay
that is also just a five minutes walk uh from the uh orchard belt area
uh okay
that's good to know
uh grand cen
and for this grand central hotel like you are gonna show me as of this moment what would be the events that is happening in that particular hotel
i mean do they show some like do they have a show for like comedy show or a theatre something like that
because some if i'm not mistaken some of these hotels have this particular event like they have a concert and buffet something like that
do they have that kind of event
uh no uh for all our hotels we don't have uh shows in the hotel itself because they don't have uh like concert theatre
so if you want to attend any concerts yes we do have big acts coming in to singapore
uh so again i have to i will have to check for you in december what are the big acts that's coming to singapore
uh the only theatre we have in singapore would be at the esplanade
ah okay
and how long is that from orchard road
well it's just one station or two station away uh from orchard road
so it's the esplanade alright
a walk away
uh this is our theatre so we can see uh what are the acts that will be coming what are the acts or musical that is in town uh

so you have a lot of options
so i'm just giving you two options since you said that you don't want to get too far away from the marina bay sands area
yes
i wanted to stay in one place where in there is a lot of happenings that's what i'm looking for in a place
so this is really a good thing that you're showing me
and thank you about that
oh that's great
well hip-hop shakedown

okay yes

it's like their i it's like their websites are fully updated every month

yah
yes okay
so these are all the different events that they are having and yes they do update quite diligently uh their website
yah
so we have the ku de ta which is a serene type of club and we have the disco
what would be the other disco or club near the marina bay
nearer the marina bay okay we have another club uh called insomnia
yes
wow i can sleep at night
you could sleep
yah
i don't think you can sleep in here
why
because there are too many things to do out here
well let see what is the happening
drink cheap okay
so are these these are the places which aren't familiar of famous in singapore
okay
yes and like i've said you said that you don't want to get too far away so i'm just uh choosing these clubs that is nearer to um where you're going to stay
yes
which is marina bay
yah
yah that's a good hotel a lot of fun
even if i'm alone
yah this is the yup
even if i get there alone yah i think i'm gonna enjoy it yah
i assure you i'm gonna enjoy it
yes
yah
so this is another one another location which is about from the marina bay sands approximately about uh ten minutes walk to the uh city hall um yah it's about twenty minutes
oh you love exercise
yes
wow walking exercise that's fun
yah
about uh
i think my fats are gonna go down
yah
because uh we have to take into account how much you want to spent in singapore right
yes
so if you're going to spend a little bit more on the hotel well then you can do a little bit of walking
it's not that far away
the closest mrt is city hall so what from marina bay you could actually take the mrt and uh stop at city hall
wow
alright
it's just about one two bus stop uh two one two stations away
two stations away uh or one and a half stations away from uh the marina bay
yes
wow
and you will be walking uh there is actually um air-conditioned underpass all the way the way from the marina bay sands right up to raffles place and from raffles place mrt one station to city hall
raffles place is a different place again
uh it is
i hope i can remember all the places that you are telling me miss lynnette
okay
if you see the place
yah
okay
so i think i've have i given you a lot of things to do in singapore for your short stay

and this is lynnette speaking
hi this is participant number thirty-two
can i get your name please
uh that would be don rommell opulencia
uh so do i call you romeo don
uh it's don rommell
don romeo alright
yah it's rommell
it's okay
it's r o m m e l l
okay not romeo and juliet huh
no it's not
okay don jum uh romeo how can i help you today
uh yah i'm planning to go to singapore
it's going to be a gift to my girlfriend
uh for any celebrations
yah well i was thinking of i will i'm planning to propose to her there
oh okay
yah
at singapore
alright
well i would give you uh maybe a very romantic place uh for proposal
okay i'd like to introduce you to this place called jewel box
jewel box
okay so
yah
what
romantic right
yes i guess so
what is at jewel box
well it's actually a dining in uh right on top of mt. faber
so it's one of the romantic place yah
most romantic place
you can see this is yah
i was kind of thinking something more of just uh the two of us
something like in the mountain or somewhere secluded
somewhere just the two of us
so there aren't really other people
just the two of us
so you know we can speak our hearts out
right okay
is there any place like that there
well we don't have mountains in singapore
we only have hills
okay
well
we have if you are talking of uh on top then mount uh bukit timah hill
um but usually it's there will be people outside on uh bukit timah hill
hm uh maybe like uh some of our uh beach front area
yah that sounds like a good idea
so it's secluded
and it could be just the two of us
okay
at the beach
yes uh well this is not really a beach
i'm just going to show you these images of this park
it's called uh labrador park
okay this is still very romantic as well
okay this is still very romantic as well
okay
you know you can see this is actually a and bridegroom taking photographs on the labrador park
it's pretty quiet in the night time
yah
yah
yah i can see the images here
you can see the beautiful scenery
yah so this is the labrador park out here
of course there s a little bit of history
you can see that and again the wedding couple taking photographs
yah i can see that yah
yah so this is quite a romantic spot uh for a proposal
so there are quite a fews uh spots
yes and this is the view of the night time sunset
yah that's great
so okay
uh i guess i'd be going there
okay so this is
i'd be taking uh
okay this is just one of the places that you can consider uh for a proposal
okay and it's not that crowded
alright in the evening there would be some people around but uh like i said it's not that crowded
alright it's just uh there will be just a bit a few people out there
that's good
i guess you can't really find a place that is that secluded anymore
yah but anyway it's a safe place
and with them a few people around
um ya i think that's nice as well
okay
so this is uh one of the location that you may want to consider
um otherwise we have lots of other parks
uh somewhere this one nearer to the uh botanical gardens
okay that sounds good
but i was actually thinking of taking her to the mall before going to you know the park
so would the would a mall be close to uh the park
sure uh okay
then i will propose okay maybe you have to look at this botanical garden
so you can see there's so many beautiful spots where you can do your proposal
alright
it's very uh and it's not crowded
again because it's big enough for you to choose your uh favourite uh place where she likes
and you can now do the proposal out there
okay the more closest to the botanical gardens would be the tanglin mall
okay
so besides that do we have any other options
um yes
let me just show you the tanglin mall
okay this is the tanglin mall
it's just at the end of the orchard belt area
and the botanical garden is just diagonally across
so you can take her to this mall first
but this is not uh this mall is not as big as the other malls in singapore
uh okay
i guess that's okay
since you know i'm going to propose and that would mean i would be uh having to save money
so taking her to a big mall would be much more of a disadvantage for me
so a small mall would do
alright
so you just want to do with just uh a quick spot of uh shopping before you go to the gardens
yah
yah
alright
okay so you could have a meal out there as well there are restaurants option uh in the tanglin mall
and like i've said you just walked across diagonally across
uh that would be about ten minutes walk
and you will be at the uh main gate of the botanical gardens
so you can just walk and uh have a nice stroll in the garden
and the garden closes its door at twelve midnight
twelve midnight
okay
that sounds good
so let me see
i'm going to be planning my trip
so first i guess i would be going to the uh botanical garden
then next i would be going to the mall
then next what was the name of the park
lab
labrador park
labrador
okay
yah so you are uh going to do your proposal in the botanical gardens
well actually no i was thinking more uh i guess i think like i'm going to have to see the place first
but most probably yah i guess
uh looking at the pictures i guess i would choose the botanical gardens
alright
now from here you are actually down in orchard road
uh so again if you just walk uh just the from the tanglin mall you just walk down
uh you will come to orchard road
uh and over that way that is actually a shopping or um hotel right next to one another
so this is actually one of the street scene along the orchard uh or tanglin shopping centre area
okay
wow
that looks good
what is that christmas season
oh yah
this photo was taken during the christmas season
okay
uh yah
but it's a quite uh old uh photograph already
okay
yah
too bad i wasn't able to go there at this past christmas
so
uh you can make it here the next the coming christmas in december
uh yah
let's see
um anyway are all these locations are close to my hotel
is that correct
uh well it depends on where you want to stay
uh around this area because this is actually at the other end of the orchard road
so it there are few hotels here
um we have the traders hotel
it's just next door to this mall
the tanglin yah i mean if you are talking about you don't want to walk too far
there's a traders hotel
everything
uh actually and i don't really mind doing the walk
since you know i'm going to get to see the place a lot more
so even if i do like long walks just to get to the place
that won't really be a problem
as long as it doesn't take me like thirty minutes or so
you know
nothing too far
okay i think this is quite a good choice uh hotel
okay i think this is quite a good choice uh hotel
um but like i said any other hotel along orchard road
since this is going to be your proposal trip
then i will propose that uh stay in a nicer hotel
so any other hotel on the street itself uh would be a relatively uh good hotel
um we have right smacked in the heart of uh the orchard hotel
we have uh a relative new hotel by the name of uh grand park orchard
trip
grand park orchard
okay
and do uh we have images of that
yes
let me just okay
this is orchard grand park
so i'm guessing sing
again please continue
this is orchard grand park hotel
and you're right smack uh you can see this is the map of orchard
okay this is one straight road
um the earlier hotels i proposed to you is on this side
on the left-hand side
and grand park will be right smacked in orchard road
um okay
okay
wa yah that looks great
so it would just take me a few minutes to get to the park
uh yup
it's about uh just a leisurely walk about twenty minutes and you'll be in the park
okay
yah okay
so that would be good
bus
alright
and uh you will be alighting at the fourth bus stop
uh bus number seventy-five
okay
so i'm guessing since uh you know uh since i'm a guy and all
i really don't have a clue to what could be or should be romantic
i'm guessing since you're suggesting these places
you find them yourself uh romantic
um yes
yes i mean i think they are uh suitable uh for a couple uh to have a nice time in singapore
and uh maybe you may want to do some uh body massage in singapore
okay
okay
well yah
that sounds good
the spa you know uh in singapore
so we do have spa treatment
um myself i think i'm okay
but i guess i would be giving that to my girlfriend
so yah that sounds good
good you good that you suggested it
it never crossed my mind
okay so okay these are just some of the option uh that we have and well there are nice places with very uh relaxing spa in singapore
for example you can uh do the one at raffles city
uh okay
uh this is in sentosa
sentosa
okay
that looks good
yah
it's uh one of our offshore uh resort island
but anyway there are also nice spa on the mainland itself
so you can always have give her uh a pamper you know
pamper her with uh a spa treatment
yah
i guess i would be doing that
uh right after i proposed
since it would be i guess we could say stressful day for um of because of all the travelling we'll be doing
so yah i guess i could be planning that on the second day
okay
so not that she has to decide whether to marry you or not eh. okay so yah nearby to grand park
yes grand park they do have this service as well
um otherwise you can have your this uh spa treatment in another hotel like for example hyatt uh fairmont hotel
uh they have all these uh spa treatment
yah
uh hm
but at traders hotel they do have spa treatment as well
uh yes
they can uh provide this service
okay
that's good
i kinda like the images that you showed me a while ago regarding traders hotel
alright
and okay
so what i would be what i'll be doing is
okay so i'm going to propose during the night
then i'm going to go to the spa just for her in case she needs some more time deciding
then what do you think would be the best next move in case you know we get to finish early
uh why don't you do why don't you give her the spa treatment in the afternoon
then you could go to the garden
so your proposal in the night time
and either you give her a nice dinner treat first uh before the proposal
that okay
that sounds that actually sounds better than my plan
so yah we'll be doing that
so spa first before the garden
yah
alright
okay
so what you can do is we have this uh very interesting or i would say uh dinner place in the botanical garden
uh which are then at the botanical gardens
um okay
okay
i'm gonna show you some images
then you can have your dinner here
and later just go for a stroll in the garden
everything look so wonderful
i'm really having a hard time choosing
yah
so you could do this option
alright
you can see
wow
this actually looks good
it will be yah
it will be western food in this uh restaurant in a colonial house
western food
okay
yah
this is that your this uh restaurant is built in the garden
alright
so ah so again very relaxing
so both of you will be in a relaxed mood
um enjoy a dinner in the garden
and then go for a stroll
you know what really um what i was thinking is like i real
re i really would like her to experience singapore
so you know uh me taking her to a dinner with western food
that's not really singapore
that's what i'm thinking right now
so it i think uh if the traders uh hotel has singapore food there
then i guess i would be taking here there instead
but unless you have any other like options for me to go to with singaporean food
okay
western food not really you know i'm going to singapore and i'm going to be eating western food
that's it's kind of out of context
okay
sure
no problem
then in that case you just get out of the traders hotel
you just go um next door to the shopping mall
shopping mall
any place more romantic
okay
than a shopping mall
then you have to uh travel a little bit
alright
um you go this placed called dempsey
that's that's okay
dempsey okay
sounds good
okay
now this is just about it will be a little bit inconvenient uh because there is no mrt ride that's so close to the little hill up here
uh so you may have to take a taxi
alright from uh orchard road
uh it's just about a ten minutes ride
uh that's
uh hm
but but from orchard road if we decide to like walk the distance towards dempsey
would that be okay
i mean you know
okay
from the traders hotel you will walk about twenty-five minutes
or twenty-five minutes
okay
that sounds
yah
if you want walk
that's that sounds okay
since we are going to be experiencing singapore while walking rights
um so there are quite a few dinner options out here
uh ranging from indian food to chinese food
of course western again um
okay
i'm going with the singaporean food
uh a lots of option um yes
uh chili crab in our chinese restaurant
um indian food uh like curries
a lot of curries
so okay
so since i'm going to be ordering uh singaporean food
what do you think should i order first
since i really have no idea as to what singaporean food has to offer
so good well one of our very popular food in uh singapore would be chili crab pepper crab
uh but it's not you don't really want to eat with your hands
chi okay
so why is that
i mean sorry you will eat with your hands
rather than eating with your spoo uh fork and uh knife
s
it's alright
so that's okay
if i use my hands or if i use my uh if i use silver ware
that's okay
yah
it's alright
it's perfectly fine when you eat crabs using your hands
it's acceptable uh etiquette uh out here in singapore
okay
now um so this is we're quite famous now
uh lot of people come here
and it's one of the must do in singapore uh having this uh crab
it's a bit spicy though i must warn you first
okay
okay
wow
okay
thank you
uh anyway i'm a fan of spicy foods
that really won't affect me
okay
if you want something a little bit uh not so exotic
we are also very famous uh for chicken rice
chicken rice
that sounds good
let me let's see what that is
yah
okay
this is chicken rice
the chili crab does look tasty you know
yes
the chicken rice is the rice is cooked with the chicken stock
uh so it's very tasty and well it's also one of our favourite food out here
chicken rice
ye wow
that really does look exotic
okay
and uh
i'm thinking she's going to enjoy those
uh okay
and of course uh satay
okay
this is satay
s
saut
it's marinated meat
you can have chicken uh mutton
satay okay
lamb
uh and of course if you buy them from the chinese store
then you'd be able to get pork satay
but if you buy them from the uh malay store owner they won't sell pork satay
uh so this is marinated meat pierced through a skewer the garnishes
uh would be onions and cucumber
and you can order a side dish of the rice uh ketupat
this is rice uh cooked in uh leaf
a packet uh leaf packet alright
and this is actually almost a complete meal already
you have your meat you have your vegetables and you have rice
uh okay
wow
okay
that does look appetising
but the chili crab really you know it does it won't cle
it looks yummy right
okay
so you can have that oh if you want to have your dinner in another place
you can choose to go to one fullerton
yah
so
i can't get the chili crab off my mind
okay
there's where you can have your chili crabs here as well
alright
they serve chili crab at one fullerton uh
okay
okay
and it's romantic as well
you'll be dining along the marina bay with the merlion in the background
um so that's very uh romantic as well in the night time
wow
so which would be further uh this one or dempsey
um well i would think that dempsey would be uh just uh off orchard road
uh you will have to walk if you really want to walk
it's about twenty-five minutes
and it's a little bit up slope and down slope
so maybe not so conducive if you are talking about um later on you're going to do a proposal
so maybe this would be a better choice
um and if you again don't want to go too far away you can just walk back on the uh one fullerton
uh just a very slow walk uh through a three miles of uh esplanade area
and you can even do your proposal at the esplanade
okay
yah
okay
at esplanade okay
so wow i'm like i have so much options now
yah
uh hm okay
so this is difficult
uh so since i'm unable to decide
let's say
yah
so you can walk back you know
remember just now you saw the bay
okay
so you just walk back a little bit uh on the three uh line and you're still walking on the bay
so it's a nice uh evening stroll out here
and again uh they are not so crowded
you can always find a spot again to do your proposal if you want to do it
by the bay or go back to the botanical gardens and do your proposal out there
actually i'm thinking this is more singaporean if i do my proposal out there
uh yah
yah because this is very iconic
uh the local would like to call this it looks like um the porcupine
yah
s oh okay
so that's
yah it looks like porcupine right
yah it looks like porcupine right
there are two of them
yah
uh well the local like to call this the durian
which you have this fruit back home as well
this is one of them is a theatre and the other one is um a concert hall
so yes only singapore have these uh two uh buildings out here
so you can just do your proposal anywhere along the marina bay
and in the night time it looks really nice
see how lighted up it is
okay
yah
okay
s that was what i was thinking
especially if the moon is out
right
the reflection
i know there's a lightning
yes it's actually a nice spot as well
yah
okay
so the crab i'm still thinking about the crab
but
but at least you can always have the crab at the one fullerton
and you just take a very short uh walk along the marina bay uh along the esplanade area
and you come to the esplanade
so a really slow takes you about uh fifteen minutes
very slow

okay
so i guess i would be doing that from my hotel uh in the morning
then i'd be going to botanical garden around lunch time
i guess
then during the afternoon i would take her to the spa
then at night i would take her to porcupine
that sound good
okay
yah
yah it sounds good
but we don't call it porcupine
we called it the esplanade
okay esplanade
okay
yah
esplanade theatres by the bay
um yes so maybe the uh morning uh botanical gardens
um yes so maybe the uh morning uh botanical gardens
uh i think you should do it in the morning when it's not so hot
oh okay
the
yah so because the park opens as early as five
so but if you are getting up uh a bit later is still fine
but uh maybe by eleven o'clock you should leave the botanical gardens
because it's starting to get a little bit warm in the afternoon
uh okay
that's good advice
so i'm guessing right now it's a bit uh humid there
because here it's actually raining
uh hm okay
we have the dry day today
uh temperature-wise it's uh well throughout the whole year it doesn't change very much
um approximately in the mid-afternoon about thirty-two degrees thirty to thirty-three two degrees
uh november december possibly about thirty degrees in the mid-afternoon
morning evening right up to about nine a.m. in the morning
it would be in the temperature range of about twenty-six degrees
and slowly rising up to thirty degrees
it's okay
okay
okay
that sounds good
so i guess i have my first whole big plan
so what do you think should i be doing on my second day at singapore
well if she accepts your proposal then of course you can do a bit of sightseeing in singapore
right
so you could do a little bit of the uh what do you called that
the photo spot to have uh some good memories of singapore
so again if you just go back uh okay i would say that you would probably have some photograph taken in the night time of the bay
as well as the merlion
alright the merlion that is facing the bay

yah
yah
wow
yah
that looks good
okay
let's scroll down again
and see whether we get the merlion
yes
okay
and can see the merlion out here
yah
i do
okay so you so you would probably be getting some spot
so the next day you don't have to come back to the marina bay
so what you do is um you can go to our ethnic areas
so i'm guessing going to eth
uh like
go ahead
okay
you can go to a place called uh kampong glam
okay
uh how do you spell that
uh what am i looking at right now
okay
just give me moment
okay
so i'm guessing this suggestion of yours
this is going to give us the singaporean culture experience
yes
so that
so you know
well you can go to this place
there uh hm. that's popular right
that lion statue thing
it's pla
the food as well
okay
okay
and this you can try again some uh malay cuisine indian cuisine arabic egyptian cuisine turkish cuisine
they can be found in this area called kampong glam
alright
now uh this street is called haji lane
kampong okay
it's quite a big street
because the shops are owned by pretty young entrepreneurs
and the kind of products they carry uh would be one of its kind
so you don't find them in uh our shopping mall
so they basically have just one shop
if you know you are not into shopping
your girlfriend not really into shopping
it's also a very nice uh way to just soak in a little bit of the atmosphere out here
uh and just have the feel of these quaint uh shops
and you can see this particular street is quite narrow
so this is haji lane over in kampong glam
alright you could always stop
alright you could always stop kampong glam
k a m p o n g. next word glam g l a m. so you could do a spot of like window shopping
uh and uh this is an area where we allow some graffiti
uh to be done to the walls uh in kampong glam
yah uh hm. kampong okay
okay
thank you
okay i you don't have to worry
since you know i'm taking my girlfriend along
she's going to be doing some heavy shopping
so
okay
so she likes some quirky fashion you know not the run of the mill fashion
yes i'm sure she should be able to pick up something uh from this lane
um you could also enjoy a sport of um shisha
it's a water pipe
shisha uh hm. water pipe
what
yes
wow
how does it work
um
water pipe uh hm
okay
this is okay
this is kampong glam here
let see whether we get any picture of these water pipes
it's um
by the way uh kampong glam is also near in traders hotel
well um singapore is not that big
alright
uh it's accessible from the mrt or the buses
okay
okay s
so it's not like well i i don't encourage you to walk from orchard road to kampong glam
okay
okay
i will take that advice
so i'm going to be taking the mrt or a bus towards kampong glam
yes that's right
okay
the mrt uh the stop that you're going to alight would be at the bugis mrt
okay
okay
so let see
i'm going to have to remember that uh hm
yah we have uh
okay uh yah i can't find any uh images of the uh water pipes
oh you could also do
but water pipes
that would be a pipes with water in them
is that that okay
so i've got
yes
flavoured water
okay
yah okay
it's a bit of like smoking
but uh instead of uh the normal way of smoking
it's filled with flavoured water
uh hm okay
yes
it's actually smoking flavoured water
smoking flavoured water
that sounds good
and we're supposed to be doing some kind of sport there
uh what
it's uh some kind of sport
sport
yah
are we supposed to like go uh swimming or diving
or is it
over here
yah uh at uh water pipe
uh no okay but now i'm showing you some photograph of what people um this is called shisha
uh shisha okay
yah so no you are not nowhere near waters at all
in the past yes kampong glam was right next to the water
but not today
okay
okay
okay
so this is the uh water pipes and that's uh available uh at the kampong glam area
okay
so i had a different idea of what it is
okay
so a picture uh says a thousand words yah
so this is the what uh shisha is all about
okay
so it's something different alright from what you would uh be able to see or do um back home
so this is one of them
uh otherwise you can always stop for um a coffee uh or tea uh with some snacks
um like curry puff

uh during our second day at singapore
i was hoping to get a little bit of historic background on singapore
but i'm really not into uh museums
so i was thinking something more of doing sightseeing
so uh hm
okay
okay alright
so you can do this uh sightseeing over in kampong glam area
you can spend about uh one hour just to walk around
um and also okay but the muslims they do not uh buy uh the normal perfumes from the normal uh kind of the perfume shops
so what they do is they buy perfumes
uh from this kind of shop they concord their own perfume
uh and they do not contain alcohol
so yes
okay this is uh perfume shops in kampong glam
so you are asking me about some sightseeing
so this is
you see all the colourful bottles that you can get from kampong glam
and you can fill them up with perfume
uh beautiful fabrics in case she wants to uh tailor some clothes from these beautiful fabrics
alright
so this is uh some sightseeing along with a little bit of shopping
and there's the houses in kampong glam very historical
more than one hundred years old
this is arab street
traditionally there was this was where a lot of the arabs used to live
and in fact a lot of the shop owners here are third generation arabs
okay uh hm
wow
uh hm so
oh okay
okay
so this is a bit of uh sightseeing cum a little bit of shopping for ethnic products
example you can take the mrt again from bugis

okay
change station at dhoby ghaut mrt train station
and proceed on to little india
so you will get to see the other ethnic area uh in little india
little india okay
lindia india
okay
again very colourful as well
uh indian temple out here
colourful flowers garlands
alright
uh light up during the deepavali season in the month of november
so this is little india
so you have a little bit of cultural aspect
a bit of sightseeing
uh the architecture and notice there are two-storey not three-storey
so a little bit of that
i'm guessing i'm thinking this place is alive during the evening towards night time
uh i would suggest that for ethnic area
it is better to do them in the day time
because there are more activities going on
in the daytime
um okay
that's good
and of course if you just walk around the esplanade area
you will see uh this building
that actually looks like a spaceship
spaceship
it's our supreme court
okay
yah so you can do a sport of uh sightseeing around the bay area
just about ten minutes walk
so you get to see the historical area
for example this green dome building
now it's undergoing restoration
this used to be our old supreme court
and um
uh hm okay
okay
and this building now that looks like i like to call it the spaceship building
this is our it's supreme court
okay
okay
so that would be the new one
the one with the dome on top
uh this one that have this yes
the one with a plate on top
yah you called it a plate
i called it a spaceship
okay
okay
so this is the new supreme court
okay
it's nice
you know if you compare the old new architecture the old architecture
um and around the this greenfield you have of course uh the colonial buildings of singapore
so that's a little bit of uh sightseeing out here
and again you'll be looking at you will also
okay
i'm feeling
okay
you are you will also be passing by some of these other historical areas
like uh the parliament house
where is that
uh parliament house
okay
it's all within the vinicity of this rectangular uh greenfield
okay
so i'm going to be able to visit all the buildings because it's close-by
yes
it's okay
uh visit as in passing by or going into the building
that looks big
this one
okay
this one is parliament house
uh if you want to visit we i would suggest by the side of the parliament house
we have a gallery
you can if you want to visit
yes you can do that
yah
uh if there is no parliament sitting uh no then there will be no entry uh into the parliament house
yah
oh okay
that sad
so there's a little bit of uh restriction going into the parliament house
otherwise the one that i showed you just now the uh supreme court
yes you are allowed to enter into the supreme court subject to the security checks
uh that we will require anyone who needs to enter into the supreme court
and i kind of just noticed a picture where there's a boat
uh if you'd scroll up a little bit
are we able to do that there
you know like to ride a uh okay
that's good
yap
okay
yes i agree
but yes
yah
so you can do a ride on this boat
we called it the singapore uh cruises
and this boat plies on the singapore river
uh hm okay
it is a half an hour ride
uh that would cost you fifteen dollars for an adult
uh it's very relaxing
you know you can do your walk around the next day second day alright
do a walk and then but if you're a little bit tired you can just go on to this boat ride
um and there would be uh english commentary on the boat
so you could do this uh boat ride on the singapore river
because the river is very historical
um and that's how singapore get rich in the early days
because this was our port
so uh yes on the boat you will get to have an idea how people used to live along the river
and these boats in the past used to ferry goods
but the boats are slightly smaller in the past
um and right now uh these boats are run on electricity
in the past they will run on diesel
okay
so that is a relaxing ride on the singapore river
yah
okay
yah okay
uh hm okay
oh okay
okay uh hm. so uh what would you suggest i take the boat ride during the afternoon or during the morning
okay
it doesn't make a difference
i would suggest that in the morning you walk around the uh padang area
where you see all the historical buildings
now take a two hours walk at or three hours walk you know if some of the buildings you may want to go inside
and in the af uh have uh a break for lunch in the surrounding area
either you uh break at the raffles place
there are some small bistro out there
uh or you can go to high street again
it's just about a five minutes walk uh from the parliament house
uh there is a food court there
that served all the street food. and aboard uh river cruise um
that served all the street food. and aboard uh river cruise um uh on the singapore river
alright
and the boat will again bring you all the way out to the marina bay
and you get to see the merlion uh from a different angle
alright
the first night you are on the edge of the marina uh of the merlion
now if you take this boat you are looking at the merlion from the waters
okay
uh hm okay
okay
okay
that sounds good
okay
so that you can do in the afternoon late morning
it's fine
uh then you could have a spot of um lunch alright a leisurely lunch
and take a rest in the uh hotel before you do another night spot again
okay
well actually the sightseeing i will be doing much more of that
but the shopping that's what my girlfriend would be there for
she would probably shop til she drops
if you know what i mean
okay
so after your boat cruise uh what you could do is you bring her back to the again if you don't want to go too far away from where you are
you could just do a very small area
then you go to the shopping centre called uh raffles city
so that would be close to the hotel still
yes
okay
alright
so raffles city uh they are like five four lev uh five level two basement area
uh where she can do her shopping
branded stuff mid-range
and if that is not enough still she can go to the underground
and do uh some serious shopping again
the underground city mall uh citylink will be just mid-range products
and if again that's not enough by the time she goes through the underground city ma uh okay this is a picture of the raffles city
by the time she walked over to another shopping mall called marina square
so yes she can really shop til she drop
okay
okay

could okay
uh i just hope i bring enough um money for that
don't worry
our shops here we accept plastic cards
okay
okay
so she can do uh spot of uh serious shopping again in the marina um uh square
alright
i'm just hoping that after all the shopping
she is going to do she is going to remember that i proposed to her you know
she might forget that i actually proposed the day before
so
okay
so you must remember to buy her a big diamond ring then
okay
alright
okay
so that's a lots of shopping uh options uh available
and again if you don't want to get too far away but if you want to see a little bit more then of course you can always go back to the orchard road
um uh for her shopping uh requirements
okay
uh thank you
uh that was a lot of shopping malls
yes
uh anyway um for our second day what do you think would be uh something unique
just like the crab but something else
i was i'm still thinking about the crab but that would be our highlight for our first day
yah for the food singaporean food
but what about the second day
what do you think should i've order first
something yah something sweet but romantic
yah and local of course
okay
oh for food is it
sweet and romantic and yet local
so are you going to have it in them in the restaurant or in the uh hawker centre at the non-air-conditioned food place
at i guess since we're going to be walking around a lot
i guess we could have it in a restaurant
okay
uh sweet okay
i mean like main courses generally they will not be sweet
um but something that is very unique and i don't think you get that in um uh philippines
uh remember the satay that i showed you
yah
i do
okay
so uh you could do that
uh do you still need me to show you the photographs of satay
no that's okay
i still remember
okay
so you can have that
yes it's a little bit uh sweet
uh otherwise one of our uh very popular dish uh would be this uh fried noodles hokkien fried noodle
frie prawn mee recipe
okay
so those are fried noodles
yah
okay
so this is the uh something which is quite unique uh in singapore
it's cooked with a little bit of seafood
alright
yes
and some of the store do serve them with a piece of banana uh leaf at the bottom
and then you can see there's a lime for you to make the dish a little bit sour
of course the chili will be a little hot
um yah something a little bit unique out here uh in singapore
okay
that i would have to remember
fried hokkien mee
okay
hokkien mee
yah
alright
otherwise if you still would like to do a little bit of sightseeing
then maybe i could recommend that you go to the night safari
night safari
okay
that sounds good
yah
okay
uh fried for fried hokkien mee that would be available on almost all the restaurants we go to there
yes
uh all the restaurant
chinese restaurant would be able to serve you these dishes
it's quite a common uh food uh that a lot of the locals like to eat
um then you can all um you could have like uh early dinner
and then proceed on to the northern part of singapore
uh by taking the train and the bus and you will arrive in the night safari park
because the park only opens in the night time
okay
okay
okay
uh this would be at around what time
the park opens at seven-thirty in the evening
okay
and it closes its door at twelve midnight
okay
so we only have a few hours
well it is enough
if you have two and a half hours to spend inside the park
uh it is more than enough time for you to enjoy the park
um i'm looking at the pictures right now
it does seem like the park is quite big
uh yes
it's quite a big park
um and what you will do is you would go on the tram ride
if you see this uh picture over here on the left-hand side
now this is a tram ride
so you get onto this tram
the whole ride without stopping will take you about forty minutes
but if you make a stop midway and you walked uh the leopard's trail
uh that will take you about half an hour to forty minutes to do the walking trail
and when you finished the trail you come back to the tram station
and you board the next tram back to the entrance
and if you still are energetic enough you can still do another walking trail
alright
uh because on the tram itself you actually get to see seventy per cent of the animals
yah uh
okay
okay
uh yah i'm hoping i'm energetic enough to do those walks
yah
it is not then it's good enough if you just do the tram ride
uh you already see seventy per cent of the animal
and i think that would be sort of a wrap up in your second uh day in singapore
wow
this looks good
so that would take me forty minutes to finish
uh yes
just on the tram ride itself without stopping
without getting off the tram you would take forty minutes
okay
so i guess that would mean that my first and second day is fully booked
yes
you would actually need more time here
but uh if you have just two days um yes this is uh maybe something that i would be able to recommend you
based on your requirements
okay
since i've got my first and second day booked i'm hoping that all the suggestions that you have given me are your personal choices you know
since uh you're female and all
i'm hoping that all these places are uh i guess i should call it close to your heart
um yes i think uh based like i said on what your uh well your coming here of course the highlight most important one would be your proposal
a little bit of sightseeing
a little bit of relaxation
and not just hopping from place to another
and i think this would be well uh what i would recommend for you to do in singapore
okay
and i'm just really hoping she remembers that i am going to propose to her
well after a nice holiday i'm sure she will remember
yah
okay so uh what do you suggest that we do next
we've got a little bit of i guess an hour and a half to relax
uh we're going to be doing the spa on the first day
and after all these uh walks on the second day
what do you think would be the best place or where do you think would be the best place to relax
well okay after the uh if you two decide to exit from the park at the main entrance area we have what we called the foot reflexology
uh hm okay
okay
and uh you will soak your feet in this pool
uh and these fishes will come and nibble at your feet
uh and they will nibble away all your dead skin
have you had this experience before
oh okay
uh no but i think my sister did
she did uh visit singapore before
it's actually the reason i chose to go to singapore
it's because of her suggestion that i visit there
so she did mention fish nibbling off her feet
so yah that's good
yes
so you could do that
uh and they have uh a spot of this uh fish at foot areas fish spa
uh just outside the um the night safari park
okay
so i guess that would complete our uh visit to singapore
yes
that you can see the picture now
the these are doctor fish
so they come and nibble at your fish
and the sensation will be a little of this uh tingling ticklish
yah ticklish effect
and then yah yes you will feel pretty relaxed after this um uh spot of uh at uh fifteen minutes
ticklish
okay
wow
it's good enough
yah uh relax
yah
so we end up the day with that
i'm ac i'm i'm uh actually thinking that this person on the picture has a lot of dead skin
so
s
maybe
yah that's why the fishes are going i think to her feet
right
crazy
they're going crazy
okay
okay
so you get this uh well spa
and you get the nice at the same time your feet feel relaxed you know after a day of walking
and your dead skins are removed
yes
so i think it's a nice day to end the day
okay
uh great
uh i guess i've got my first day and second day complete now
so uh great
thank you
i really enjoyed our conversation
thanks very much for calling us
um hey uh would you mind if i ask for your name again

lynnette okay

okay so thanks again don romeo
right
okay

and rommell is okay
okay
alright um
okay
okay
bye
thank you
bye
okay
bye
hello
hello good afternoon
good afternoon
i'm jeanne guide number two from singapore
may i know your name
i'm jen cantos and i'm participant number thirty nine
number thirty nine
jen is it j e n
yes
yes that's correct
okay
uh how can i help you jen
uh i haven't been to singapore and i heard that it's a great place
uh i would like to ask you for uh suggestions of the places that i should uh be visiting there
and by the way uh i have
my budget is around one thousand singaporean dollars and i plan to stay there for two days
um i'm not quite sure if my budget would be enough
could you give the suggestions so i could be able to maximise my budget
your budget is more than enough for because two days is only one night
so you can in fact stay two nights
oh that's great
that's great
uh but i need to know who are you travelling with please
um i plan to tag my friend along so there would be
so you're bringing your friend okay
how many of uh sorry
so two of you only is it
yah
yes correct
and it's a girl you are travelling with
yes
okay and you are in your twenties i assume
actually i'm in my thirties
oh you sounded a very young thirty then okay
thank you
well you're still young at thirty so it's not a problem huh
uh can i know um what are your preferences
what do you normally enjoy uh back home
yah
uh i like to uh well i live in the city so i would like to spend some time in a place where there is greenery and stuff
could uh i know there are places like that in singapore
uh you want to stay in places where's there is greenery uh garden setting is it
yes
well we have resort hotels on sentosa island
but uh for two nights it might be a little bit uh costly unless you stay uh on the beach front
uh we have a more affordable hotel on the beach front that i can recommend to you so you can walk around the island and enjoy the beaches as well
is that suitable for you
hm i think that it would be great
but uh although i'm really not limiting myself to uh those kinds of places
i would also like to see the city itself all the uh structures the buildings and the city lights
that would be great also
okay
okay the city lights uh the architecture is very uh accessible from the island because uh this island is off the south of singapore and it's also uh you know connected by train and by road
so let me show you a map of singapore so that you have an idea of locations
okay
okay
and then you can uh make up your mind if you like that or not
alright
so can you get the map on your screen
yes i'm seeing it
okay
so i'm trying to enlarge it for you
so here you see singapore with its neighbouring country malaysia to the north of us
so we are an island surrounded by water
and the island i'm suggesting you stay is right down south
uh sort of triangular shape
if you see bukit merah on the map can you see it
where is it
where
in the south
in the middle of the island right at the bottom
alright
alright
you saw that
yes
okay across from there there are two islands
and the bigger island is sentosa island
alright
okay so now you can see it
yes
now the city and all these other lines did you see
uh these are roads
and later i'll show you a map of the subway system
alright
which is also integrated with the bus system uh at bus interchanges at there
there are lots of people using public transport
so it's very easy to move around in singapore
okay
so aside from the bus uh i can also take the train
yah
yes uh in fact i suggest you take the train because it's faster and it's uh
is it cheaper
uh actually travel is by distance
so by distance the trains are more expensive to set up
so it would be a little bit more expensive for journeys
uh short journeys that you do in town will just cost you uh a dollar twenty if you go little bit further out
and bus journeys uh will be under a dollar
uh this is just a rough guide
let me show you where uh the airport of singapore is and with the train connections
so i'll show you the mrt map
okay
oh okay
oh okay
alright
so mrt is the mass rapid transit
and that is the name of our uh subway which is also above ground in certain parts
and the lrt you saw on the map is a light rail to support it
that one i don't think you'll be taking
it leads people right up to the doorstep
so can you see uh number three on the map
number three yes
yes on the right
yes
so this is the eastern tip of the island
and that is our airport international airport
so if you come in here and you go down to the basement there is an office that will sell you the tickets for the subway
and you can put value in it
in fact you have to put value in it so that uh as you use the subway and the passes
the value is deducted
okay
so they a tour advantages you don't have to worry about the fare and you also don't you also get a discount
every time you connect the journey uh you'll get a discount
so it makes it very attractive
oh okay
so for all the places i'm seeing now uh i just have to use uh one card
uh i do not have to change cards for every uh let say for every area or
yes that's right
no you don't have to
okay
okay
uh the card is called the ez-link card
ez-link
yah it is the size of a credit card
okay
and it's a contactless card
so you just tap it at the sensor when you are entering the stations
and tap it at uh when you come out the gate will open when you are on the subway
and if you are in the bus you must remember to tap it when you get off the bus
because otherwise uh the system will assume that you've taken the journey right up to the end
because they are not reading anything on your card
so you tap in and you tap out
so that's what you need to do
okay
okay huh
so that is very easy uh and you can get the cards
uh well for me at the airport for you is the most convenient
but if uh you suddenly travel all over singapore you have used up all the value
uh you can go to a seven eleven store that's open twenty four hours and you just put in a little bit more money
oh okay
oh so it's so there is an extra charge if i'll uh i'm going to buy it seven eleven
no it's not extra you're just putting value into the card
so uh this makes it convenient because seven eleven stores are all over singapore
uh even at petrol stations
so you if you should run out of money in the card
but usually i suggest that people uh put in more than enough and then when they leave go back to the officer and get your refund uh before you leave
so you don't have to worry about it
uh you can also use the card for sightseeing
i did it once with a friend
i use the trains to go all around singapore uh and once we're out of the city it is above ground so you can see all around you
yah the only thing is we came back to her hotel so which was uh it showed on the card that we had uh travelled only maybe one-stop away because we stop one-stop away from her hotel
and we have to pay two dollars surcharge
this is to discourage people using the system uh to make friends chit chat inside you know the train station so cause they are very comfortable
so that is the only thing yah
and you can do that to because i think two dollars is the very uh small fee to pay right
oh that's great
okay
yah
yah
um so where do you want to live in singapore
where do you want to stay
uh so you want a beach hotel or you want to stay in an ethnic area
uh can you explain me what can i see in an ethnic area
okay ethnic area we have two uh that is uh very easily uh connectable for you you can from there to other places
one is chinatown and one is little in
oh okay
so in chinatown you get more uh chinese food souvenirs
uh in little india you can have a big variety of indian food uh and you can visit a lot of hindu temples
uh in uh little india in fact we have uh buddhist temple and also a church there
a few churches in fact uh within the area because we are multi-cultural and multi-religious
also in chinatown at the heart of chinatown in fact it's one of older hindu temples which is also a national monument
and our oldest chinese temple is there and it's all within walking distance
oh that's great
but you won't get your greenery around there you know
so if you want a greenery you want a resort view then it would be sentosa island
hm so um if i'm to compare which would be cheaper between the two places if uh when i speaking about hotels
okay where price is concerned uh little india and chinatown has uh lower priced hotels
because in their locations the rents are lower than in the island
uh so on the island i think about two hundred dollars you should be able to get a hotel a decent size hotel
which is also a good rate
in chinatown well you don't want a dormitory do you
where you share the bed with other people
oh no
yah so if you want to have a room to yourself about eighty to a hundred sixty uh you should be able to get a decent size uh room in chinatown
that's per night right
yes per night yes
will that also include meals
uh meals it depends on the hotel
some of them do not provide meals because all around where the hotel is there are food outlets
so sometimes it not worth the while to provide the meal
so it actually depends on the individual hotel
oh alright
and how about the hotels in the other area
in little india you can get hotels in this price range and even cheaper
so uh what sort of food do you enjoy
uh i'm really not into the exotic food so i'd like to place just that um safe food
not the exotic ones
safe food so in uh safe food so do you have chinese food in your country
uh so
uh yes
so uh i'm more familiar with chinese food than indian food
so
yah indian food the only problem is if you take too much chili and some people can find it too hot on the tongue
so
yes i'm not into that
so i think chinese food is safer for me
okay so we will check out the hotels in chinatown
and we'll show you a variety and with their prices
and so you can have a look
alright
chinatown is busy day and night but they have other uh they have hotels along the small streets they have hotels along the main road
so i can tell you from the location whether it's a quieter part of chinatown or not
uh we also have very good class boutique hotels in chinatown
and here you can soak up the atmosphere
okay
uh if you're thinking of regular size hotels you know the normal idea of hotel it would be furama city centre
can you see uh on the screen
where is it
furama yes i can see it
yes furama city centre
so eu tong seng street is one of the main road in chinatown
uh below that you see another road called keong saik road and that is a small lane off the major roads of chinatown and it's on the quieter side of chinatown
also bukit pasoh and here you can see the hotel price it is also like a business hotel rate huh
yes
it's quite expensive
yes so i think uh we will not consider that right
what do you think
no
okay i thought you would like the money for shopping or some other thing huh
uh we have also new bridge road which is also along the main road uh santa grand hundred and forty eight
and santa grand has two hotels one they call it chinatown hundred and forty eight and lai chun yuen which is hundred and forty five
so it's about same price
yes
lai chun yuen is uh closer right into the heart of chinatown
even better we have this one along the side street the inn at temple street
can you see it
yes
uh that's only one eight
and below a hundred keong saik hotel
it takes his name from the road
uh the quieter side of town
on the quieter side also at the bottom we have scarlet hotel but you can see the price it's two six five
it is a
it's luxury class
yes it's luxury class yah
so uh porcelain hotel is on the main road
so uh maybe a little bit busier when you come out
so it's your choice whether you want to be just off the main street or you would like to be in the on the main road because off the main street you just walk out and five minutes you're into the shopping area into where the restaurants the cafés the street side shopping is
off the main road is also maybe three four minutes away
uh i prefer the off the main road
off the main road
okay let's have a look again
okay
so furama city centre is off because that is main road
okay off the main road we have i think at uh the upper end is the hotel nineteen twenty nine and it's very popular it's very trendy
it was one of the first hotels in chinatown converted out of places where people use to shop
uh start to shop downstairs and live upstairs
uh we also have a new majestic that's three hundred so we forget about that right
yes
uh we have the most affordable here the attractive price is the keong saik hotel
uh and the other one is the inn at temple street
uh quieter side of chinatown is keong saik street
uh temple street you are actually uh in the heart of uh where people eat and uh shop
so it's like you go downstairs and there are shops all around
i think it that's a good place to stay in
okay so you want to be in the heart of the action but not along the main road right
yes correct
okay so let me write this down the inn at temple street
and the name temple street is because there is one of our oldest hindu temples uh over there
so let me show you
there you go
if you want to book alright
uh when are you deciding to come
um probably on the first week of april
first week of april
yes
uh i think prices withhold yes
let me see
is it the same set of prices
uh it would goes up a little bit in april huh
uh thirty first of march the price is one eight
one hundred thirty yah this one
yah one hundred so about twelve dollars more
um that's okay
uh that's okay
uh you look at the price here
so whether you are by yourself or with your friend it's the same price a hundred and thirty dollars
so you can afford two nights
yes
right
yes so that would be two hundred and sixty dollars
but uh there is no breakfast you ha eh it's not a problem with breakfast because you can always uh just walk out as i said
and you can have breakfast over there
okay
let me show you some uh pictures and images of the hotel
so that you have a better uh idea of where you are staying huh
so this is the outside the facade of the hotel
and this is the lobby
so it's quite homely isn't it
yah
but the uh the facade is it that an old building
yes all the hotels along this little streets are converted shop houses
uh and well this may not be a shop house itself it could be a clubhouse or whatever
but uh for the majority of the hotels they are made up of buildings where peopl used to live upstairs and they run a business downstairs
and it's like it's the same as your hotel although i haven't check up on this particular address
so the hoteliers un undertook a conservation of the building by restoring it and so the inside was changed
uh previously uh there was one staircase leading down
and there were very it was very cramp
there would be little cubicles where people live
but here you see it's like a regular small boutique hotel
so instead of the shop you have a lobby your reception area uh as you enter
yah it looks classy though
yes very classy
so it's quite a bargain for a hundred and thirty dollars right
and from that little table and chair they have tried to put some of the older furniture which has become very popular nowadays huh so you can see the room has got a bathroom attached
right so this is acceptable for you
yes
okay uh would you like to see some of the food you can get
sure
uh in chinatown since you are not getting breakfast
uh what we like to eat in singapore which is uh nutritious and tasty is called kaya toast
uh kaya is
kaya
yah
yes kaya k a y a
oh okay
it is uh uh i don't know whether you can call it a jam
it is made of uh coconut
uh you know the flesh the coconut
we squeeze out the juice and then we put in eggs and uh natural fragrance called pandans leaves
yes
so it is cooked and it's stirred constantly and in the old days this was done by hand
i don't know even now whether they have a machine to do it
you can see it there uh a shop that is very well known called yakun to
kaya toast um hm
yah
uh let me show you the picture here
yah
uh can you see here spread the word
so they have made the recipe out of uh coconut milk sugar eggs and pandan
sugar eggs fragrant panda um hm
so it's natural no artificial colouring or flavouring
the flavour is from the leaves
and yakun is one of the most places
in fact i just had uh their breakfast this morning
and here it's like a little café
nothing fancy but very affordable
so you can put kaya on it or you can just put butter
and we also like sugar on the toast
or cheese
so instead of ham and eggs or bacon and eggs i think this is more traditional for us and maybe you want to try it
um hm you're making me hungry now actually
yah lucky i had lunch
uh here the bottom and they do it perfectly
soft boiled eggs um hm
the eggs
and what we do is we take it with dark uh soy sauce
you know soy sauce made from soya bean
so the dark kraft is very thick
they use quality uh dark soy sauce and if you like you can put in a lot of pepper
yes
yes
uh i like to swallow the yolk whole and that's yes
so i eat the whites and then i swallow the whole yolk it's very yummy
but

careful on that though
oh yes well i don't eat that everyday uh just a treat once in a while
and uh you so to finish up you can have the kaya on toast
so you have it's like a desert you know what i mean
so you have the savoury eggs and then you have the sweet toast
and there's ice cream toast
yes ice cream toast
uh that would be maybe in the afternoon
when it's a bit warm so singaporeans get off the street they want something to pamper themselves without spending too much so they will uh ask for ice cream toast kaya toast or butter sugar
have you tried that
butter sugar toast
you butter the toast bread and then you sprinkle sugar on it
it's not good for your diet but yummy
i'm not going to have that everyday anyway so that's okay
no you yah
just two days you know uh uh yakun outlets are all over singapore and you can find them in shopping centres you can find them along the roadsides you know where you're shopping
uh because it's a chain
the family has uh opened up many outlets all over
yah so uh what else would you like me to find for you uh
uh since i'm still uh undecided with although the inn you showed me a while ago is uh that looks like a good deal
but uh i would also like to have other options
uh what's the other place that you uh say
so you want the hotels in little india
no um the other i think the beachfront hotel
hotels are
okay the beach one
alright the sentosa hotels
okay
sentosa has uh one hotel that is not very expensive on the island
and they also have resorts style very classy hotels
so there is a choice
in singapore we have lots of choices
so you can always budget accordingly
so that's the view of the island and the beach is on one side of the island
so uh on the list there you can see some uh resort hotels
you don't want resort hotels so you can uh scroll down and find one uh sentosa beach hotel
let's try and get the hotels again okay
it's uh loading now
okay
let me find it for you
okay
i see that there are no prices included in this page
okay there are two we can look at
there is costa sands and there is also siloso beach
so it's on a popular beach with many attractions
and here we have costa sands
wait
you're having a view of the place
yes i can see it now
okay
so costa sands let's look at the rates
uh let me see
can you see up here
yes
uh just on the side bar it's eighty nine dollars to two hundred and fifteen dollars yes
fifteen
so let me try and find it for you
okay
the two hundred over dollars a night would be i think a hotel room
and there can you see it here uh they have another hotel elsewhere
so we have to make sure that we put you on sentosa island
so you said april do you have a date for april
could you click the calendar for me
i do not have a calendar
okay
okay we get the april month for you
okay
april uh we have march there we'll get down to april
april
yes okay
so the first of april is uh sunday
so um okay
if it's two nights you'll stay till the third is that right
or do you want to go another day in april
how about april seventh
which da april seventh okay we'll try for april seventh
so it's a weekend also
april seventh and departing on the ninth is that right
right
so it's saturday till monday
so you have the weekend there
oh i'm sorry they have no room
no room
to bad
to ba if you pick uh a weekday i think you'll definitely get a room
how about um could you show me the calendar again
there is a the calendar and then you can see the actual day you want to have
how about april five
april five that's a thursday
april five yes
five in and the seventh out okay
five to seven
oh no
okay
there are no room oh no rooms
sorry i looked at it okay
uh i think your other friends have booked it already
let's try another date
do you want to get okay
uh wait
you try another date further down in april
how about yes the eleventh
eleventh to thirteenth
and we see whether you have luck this time
so here can you see the rates
yes
one eighty nine
what's a kampong hut
uh kampong hut is a small structure it supposed to uh resemble the uh but you see the deluxe room that's a deluxe room that you are seeing over there
okay
so that is the difference
some people prefer that uh they go to the uh kampong hut because of the nostalgic uh feelings that it gives them
but is it air-conditioned
no
uh you have a look at it the rooms have definitely air-conditioned for the uh one that's a hundred and eighty nine dollars
kampong hut forty nine dollars i'm not sure
uh let's see okay
because forty nine dollars uh is a little too attractive let say for a beachfront
and also some people uh they like to have the sea breezes
i used to do that when i was uh in school
so you open the windows and you can hear the water you can hear uh the crickets in the background you know
so if you have air conditioning you are actually shutting out the natural environment
uh you have a point there
yes so uh for me because i like to go to as natural setting as possible so uh the kampong hut would be very attractive for me
uh i mean if i were the visitor
but if you prefer creature comforts you need your air conditioning then uh the hotel room will be more the regular type of hotel that you will be able to enjoy
so uh you can see that uh there's a swimming pool
but of course i think you perhaps want to swim in the sea
the sea is very uh calm it's a sheltered bay
and for some people if they don't like the salt water then they can also use the pool
the pool
yes you can use both
i think this is the kampong hut here
okay
could you click back
yes
so here it is
they didn't mention air conditioning
it seems like it may be
i'll try and find out for you
i don't know why it doesn't say whether it's air-conditioned or not
but you see it's all closed in
you get what i mean
so um
probably it is
yes probably it is
uh so uh you still get your air conditioning but i think the size of the place is perhaps a little bit smaller
especially for two people
uh no i think two people if you're not gonna spend a lot of time in the room it should not be a problem
okay it's air-conditioned
uh you get what you get are two double-decker beds
uh and you also okay the only difference and this is the catch you there's a common toilet and shower facilities nearby
oh so it's we have to share
so you'll yes you have to share
so in fact the room isn't that small because you can have two double-decker beds and that means if you came with three other friends you'll still be able to stay there
um hm
so some people on tight budget that's what they'll do
they save their money for shopping or eating
but the only problem is we have to share the comfort rooms
yes that is right
that's why you know the price is so low
it is even under fifty dollars
so what is your preference
uh what
the hm i'll go with the deluxe room
you're going with the deluxe room okay
so this is the deluxe room uh very classy huh
there
so here you see the hotel
so there's the neighbouring carts
okay so the deluxe room uh let's have a look at the rates for the deluxe room
uh the deluxe room then would give you more space uh more uh comfort level
and you also feel more like a tourist okay
we have to find out if it's available
was it eleventh
what date was it your
eleventh
yah eleventh to thirteenth okay
yes eleventh thirteenth
eleventh to thirteenth
okay here you are it's a hundred and eighty nine dollars
so that would be the standard deluxe
that's okay
uh that's okay
so i can see you like some luxury
we can put it at let's say hundred and ninety dollars times two um that's uh three hundred and eighty dollars for your rooms alright
and so then you'll be on the beachfronts and there are forest walks that you can do there okay
so we forget about little india and chinatown
yes
so what about sightseeing what are your preferences
what sort of things that would you like to see whilst you're here
uh are there botanical gardens in singapore
oh yes uh we have a botanic gardens that is very well-known
and sentosa also has greenery all around
uh i'll get you the information on the botanic gardens
it's the singapore botanic gardens
okay
and uh it's a huge place and most people uh when they don't have too much time they visit the orchids okay
because the within the orchid enclosure we have many orchids that are in bloom that are on display
we also have a little forest uh right near to where the orchids are
and it's a very uh what should i say
very comfortable forest because you can walk on a pathway and uh you see huge trees over a hundred and fifty years old right next to you but uh you don't have to step on mud
so it's quite comfortable
and we have also a ginger garden within the area
and these areas are very near to each other
so ginger's uh consist of eight families and some of them uh they are grown for ornamental reasons
so besides the ginger that you use for cooking we have also you know colourful flowers that people use to decorate hotel rooms uh their own houses if they have a big uh living room
and so here you can see the gardens
uh you see the band stand there that dates
right over a hundred years
i don't know yes
so we don't have a band playing there now because it's too small
but here you can see some of the attractions
uh let me show you okay the hours the visiting hours
uh actually i know it opens uh five a.m. in the morning
oh admission is free
so oh yes to the gardens it's free
that's good news
a very good news
you just have to pay to see the orchids
and uh you because that's special that's very special yah
so i'm talking about the national orchid garden
it's five dollars
and this section closes at seven
but you could go jogging around the garden till twelve midnight
till twelve midnight um hm
yes uh and you can go for romantic walk you know if you had bought your boyfriend along
uh but you and
i'm bringing a girl
uh huh you can bring a girl
maybe when you're walking you'll meet some ha a lot of handsome guys you know that live near the area
they go there and they jog and uh so it's nice also to have a look at other things besides the flowers there
and we have you know senior citizens it's only one dollar
this is only if you see the orchids
interesting
uh if you are visiting the forest the ginger garden uh ecological garden it is all free of charge yah
um and your friend is an adult
so you cannot visit jacob ballas
it's a children's garden
uh okay
yes
oh okay if you are serious about botany there is a very good library okay
uh we can this part of the gardens you can approach by bus uh and just walk there
uh to this area
it's very easy to visit
now let me show you the attractions
we have there also um very old tree
uh let me go to the tanglin halt
okay this is the map of the area
so if you were to visit the gardens uh okay
you could either stop your bus over here at tanglin gates and then you walk in through a lovely garden here and then there is the lake and you can carry on you can see the swans in the lake
then you can carry on and uh further down the walk would be the orchid enclosure as well as the uh ginger orchids
if you want to see sculptures you walk the other way
we have some sculptures and we have huge uh heritage trees
can you see here this one called ceiba pentandra
that is actually the cotton tree we call it the kapok tree
and if you are lucky
kapok
yes it's i don't know if you are familiar with this when babies were born we didn't want to give them polyester filled pillows so there were people who collect uh the cotton that is inside the pod and then it's save up to make a pillow for the baby
and the tree is very huge there and many people like to take photographs there
so today it's one of our heritage tree so we try to protect it
uh further down is another tall tree here also a heritage tree
and if you go around the corner uh can you see vanda miss joaquim
uh that would be where the uh ginger garden and the orchids is located okay
okay so it's nice to get in from there and then uh you can see all the other parts of the gardens and then this is the ginger garden
can you see burkill gates
on the left
yes
yah so lots of colourful uh plants there
and we also have useful gingers uh turmeric uh the normal ginger that you eat
and as you proceed up uh it's a very short road inside the gardens
you see national orchid garden at the top
so that is where we have uh the orchids
and it's a three-hectare site you need about forty five minutes to visit the orchids alone to enjoy
quite big
to take pho oh yes so uh it's because there's it's so interesting here i think three quarters or an hour is the minimum to enjoy this
so maybe if you provide um three hours to go to the gardens and you know you can also walk the forest
the forest is just nearby
and then you would have seen maybe only half of the gardens
yah so this is the biggest garden the oldest and the most popular in singapore
so
yah
it's also very chea
yes because it's free
it's only just it's free yes uh uh i'll show you some heritage trees or they have don't let me see if there are pictures
oh this is just may be for scientist to know uh the size of the tree and also where it's located
yah so no pictures not so interesting okay
so botanic gardens is a must see yes
if you enjoy uh gardens
but we don't have a sector on let me see
they don't feature the forest
let me try
oh bukit timah is not
it's not the attraction but let's have a look at bukit timah
yes
okay here if you are interested in herbs and spices
uh it's a further walk down to another section of the gardens and we have another lake there
so here it's uh what we call an economic garden
you can see nuts and beverages crops
because originally when the british came the gardens was used to experiment to see which spice trees what useful plants could be grown here
do
so we've
do they sell goods there
yes uh the best
nuts and fruits
uh not nuts and fruits but uh souvenirs like but within the national orchid garden uh we have a company called risis
it i the first company to come up with the technology to encase a real flower and uh preserve it
so uh by some scientific method they have etched gold to the uh real orchid flower
and you can use it as a pendant or a brooch
and of course that shop has other souvenirs as well
but the spices uh the herbs is more for educational purposes
yah
i see
we have uh plant sales but i think the gardens gets nurseries to sell their plants there
so we also do research here
so i think they not so keen on the commercial side of the business
yah
so this is the gardens for you
what else would you like to see in singapore
alright
i think that would be all
is that all or you want to have uh other areas uh whether it's museums or natural places
i can find for you
uh how about zoos
zoos okay we try and get the zoo for you
the zoo is part of a three attractions that is run by wildlife reserves in singapore
so here i'm gonna open up and let you see
also within the zoo uh bird park and night safari which are the three attractions
they are like gardens because of the landscaping
but the landscaping is more towards the natural environment of the inhabitants
so like here were plants um fruit trees for the birds and tall shady trees and where the same trees are found in africa and can survive in singapore we also got them
this is uh waterfall aviary it's a walk in aviary
that means you actually can you can be inside with the birds you know what i mean
walk in um hm. really
yes
so uh you can feel very close-up to them
it's not like you're looking at the cage
the birds are free flying
and we also have the largest waterfall uh that is man-made in this area which is also good for photography
and if you are tired you don't want to walk you can take uh panorail which is an air-conditioned train within the park
and as far as i know it's the only panorail that enters a bird aviary
so when you get off the tram you're already inside this aviary
and you can see the birds feeding you can uh wait
if you map your tour according to the feeding times you can feed them
yah
so this is the day attraction
uh you want to have uh the uh zoo is that right
yes
okay
so the zoo is also a day attraction
in other words it closes in the evening on about six o'clock
and here we have have you see this creature bef
nudist colony
yes i haven't seen it myself but i must go there just to see it
uh they call it naked i think
mole rats
rats usually have fur but this one doesn't have fur
and the teeth are used for tunnelling
this is just one of the attractions there
have you seen orangutans before
uh i think only at national geographic
national geographic yes
well here you can see uh they are free-ranging in other words uh up on the trees they are swinging around and one of the highlights is uh if you have breakfast
so is it safe
it's very safe because these are breed in the zoo
and uh they are tamed uh
okay so the restaurant you saw is air-conditioned if you are too hot you can go in and eat
but it's glass all around so you can look out and you can see the orangutans
their free-ranging area is right there
so for twenty nine dollars uh in the morning if you go so the outside area is ah meng terrace named after an ambassador uh who was an a female orangutan called ah meng
and you'd be able to have breakfast and at the same time you can after your breakfast take a photograph with the orangutan
they actually pose for pictures
uh they don't really pose they are sitting there
and uh i haven't seen an orangutan smile
uh but yes i know
uh if you are lucky there is a baby and then you can see uh the mother and the baby
so if their baby is there don't touch the baby
you know mothers are naturally protective of the babies
just kidding
yes
so this is bigger picture
so the orangutan is nearby but it doesn't care for your jam and rolls
and it will have fruits like uh bananas durian
do you know durian
yes
they're smelly but it's very delicious uh very creamy and it will be eating that
so after breakfast you'll be invited to take photos with the orangutan
and they also now bring out other animals out uh with their handlers
so if you want to go near uh touch or take photograph uh you check with the handler and the handler will know the mood of the animal at that time
usually they bring the ones that are very uh visitor friendly
so this is one of the things that you can see uh at the zoo in the day time yah
uh i'll show you uh the shows let me see huh
no let me see the animal appearance
okay
there you go
this is a very handsome python called the golden python
and it's with the handler so uh if you uh do you like snakes or are you
uh do you like snakes or are you
i'm afraid of them
so you're afraid them you need not touch it but you
yes
it's good to take this opportunity to just feel it it's very smooth it's cold
as long as it will not attack me that's okay
that's fine for me
no they won't attack you the keeper is there and in this picture you can see it is holding up you know the snake quite well
um sometimes at the visitor sites other visitor sites outside the zoo we have uh snake charmers who have their own cobras
uh and if you are afraid of touching the head you can touch the tail
no that no that's a cobra
that's a different story
that's what some of my tourist do
uh sorry not cobra i said the wrong thing
phy
yes no cobra sorry
we used to have what we called the black mamba that looks like a cobra but they stop using that because the tourist uh were frightened
but uh the mamba it's actually a tame variety which the people bring in
but at the zoo uh they have the golden pythons whose uh habit is only to wind themselves around uh you know if they catch something they want to it they wind themselves around it
but you know this size especially if they do say wind themselves around your hand the keeper will be there to remove it
so it's not a problem yah
oh yah
uh let's see if we can see other attractions
here we go
so you are looking at all the animals
this is a family of orangutans
we have crocodiles and monitor lizards
and this is the australian outback
okay let through
these are the more exciting animals
here we have the leopards and uh we also have here elephants
asian elephants who do a show and you can feed you just pay a few dollars for the food okay
okay
uh fragile forest is where you can see see this one you have to go to madagascar to see so yah
yah um hm
this is also like the walking aviary
it is a forest that you walk-in to
there's a huge net around it
it's a big area and as you're walking around you can take photographs of these animals yah
and these are fellows from africa uh baboons himalayan hamadryas baboons
we also have polar bears and there's a polar bear show
so this one looks like the singaporean polar bear who was born here
so he has air-conditioned surroundings yah
so these are some of the animals you see at zoo
so does it attract you or
yes very much
hm yes
yes uh
okay show one more to tempt you further
this is uh the most popular attraction because it is very rare
it is a white tiger and it's due to a mutant gene uh found in indian and reproduced
so uh many people see not only the regular tiger but the white tiger okay
so uh let me try to get you to the price of the night safari
uh sorry the price of the zoo uh although we do have uh package ticket where you see the several parks and you get some discount
so here we go
i told you that it's run by wildlife saf uh reserves
so we have uh special pricing with discount built in
if you visit two attractions uh you get a discount
see if you visit the zoo alone that is twenty dollars
do you see there
uh if you add-in the night safari it's forty two
and if you combine it with the bird park it is thirty two
so it's only up to you you know um how much time you have and uh what you want to see
so i guess for the two days i'll be staying in singapore i can i'll be able to enjoy my stay um visiting the zoo and the botanic gardens
so i think uh that's fine for me
i
yes zoo botanic gardens uh you can even do the night safari it's next to the zoo
now you can do a lot and you have a lot more money left uh to do shopping
yes correct
so that's it
uh yes that's right
yah
oh good uh i hope i have been of help to you
yes
thank you very much
you're very welcome jen and look forward to seeing you and your friend
alright
see you soon
alright bye
bye
see you bye
bye
bye
bye
yes goodbye can you hear me
yes
yes okay
alright
okay
hello good afternoon
hi good afternoon
i'm uh participant number uh forty
four zero
yes ma'am
and your name sir
uh my name is marlowe that's m a r l o w e
m a r l o w e with an extra e
l o yup that's right
okay i thought it's like marlon brando
wow
yup that's right
my name is jeanne j e a n n e and i'm tour guide number two
how may i help you marlowe
alright
um well i'm planning to visit the um uh singapore by around uh during the race uh weekend uh for formula one
um i'm thinking what are the places that i can uh go to if uh during that time
for uh that's the september period
uh you will be at the formula one to watch the races so i think it's better if i get you uh attractions that are near the formula one venue
ah but uh do you want to settle where you want to live first where you want to stay
uh hm that would be great
yah that would be best um cause i wanna um be ne just near or like uh in a hotel or um a place which is just a walking distance from the race track
okay yes
that's very wise because if you take public transports um some of the roads are closed off because it is uh what you call it
the approach roads to the venue
that's a
yup
it's a street race i believe so some of the r uh local roads are uh usual uh they're gonna close it but um that are usually open
okay there is a beach road hotel and beach road is just adjacent to the race track and it's very near
and it's you know the public transport will also not be uh passing by because i think they will not be allowed there because the road leads uh into the race track area
yah
yah
yah
i see
um jeanne i don't want really any uh fancy stuff for the hotel so just basic um where i could just rest uh because i also want to uh go around the city um just before the races
oh yes of course
this hotel is not the high priced one
there are high priced ones where uh right on the race track
uh those prices uh are much higher during the period of the race because that's you know um
yah make sense
yah and the people who are really keen on uh the race some of them they don't mind spending hundreds of dollars on it
but here we have uh okay
can you see on the screen
i see yah
yup
um i think the first or the second one uh the beach hotel or the park view hotel would be great
yes
yah
yes that's uh it's very sensible because it is uh you know in the same location as parkroyal and of course raffles hotel is eight hundred dollars that's a five-star
yah okay
yah that's yah that would be out of my reach
reach yes
yah
do you have the dates or do you want us to find the dates for you the formula one race
um basically the same weekend uh during the race
i think that's uh the second or third week of uh september right
yes
usually it's uh last weekend i think it's the third weekend at the end of the month
uh it is the twenty first twenty second and twenty third
um okay
yup that would be perfect
for this year okay
um okay
how much do i save if in case we book a little bit earlier just like re maybe right now if we can book them so that we can uh maybe save something um uh as compared to uh booking them right before the race weekend
uh booking them the right on the race weekend i think it's near impossible it will be fully booked already
yah i know
yah
so uh if you book now here it says a hundred and thirty dollars book this
uh when are you i mean how are you travelling
are you with a friend or are you coming alone
uh i'll just be alone uh for the travel
okay
so it's just one single room huh
yup
uh it's actually the same price if you see here
because they are not supplying a breakfast
yup
so let see if uh they are available and whether the hundred and thirty dollars still holds
okay
september you want to come in on the twenty first
um i think twentieth s um that would uh would be okay or the twenty first
um i'll check my uh tickets
i think that's gonna be on the twenty first early uh part of the day like um around eight o'clock in the morning
uh yes that's ideal
yes
yah
yah
you could even walk around you know and have a look at the place
and so you can in fact leave on the twenty fourth morning
i think at
yah right
yup
alright that's correct
because that would be after the race
okay 2012
and you only want one room right
right
okay
so let's have a look
um okay
we have to wait for the response and see if they have rooms or uh what sort of price
they have put there normally that's uh you know it's a hundred and thirty dollars if you book now
so uh
i see
that would be perfect
um and there are a lot of uh places where uh we can uh get something to eat um like almost uh twenty four hours uh a day right
yes
in singapore we are very greedy nation we are eating all the time
wow
yah
uh i really like to um try again some of those um food from the street hawkers like um those pork roast and stuff
uh okay
there's a market that is uh very near you within walking distance and if i walk the same distance because when i go by bus my bus stop somewhere near there
and uh there you can get uh local food
uh i'm not sure if i can get you uh whether they have uh a website because this it's what we used to call a hawker centre but we don't have hawker centre uh so it's called a food centre and it's called the beach road
wow perfect
ah yah
perfect
um hm yah
okay
that would be fine
er i as long as there are um something to eat uh somewhere near that would be fine for me
yes
uh around the hotel also uh there are places that you can come out and eat and if you want something in an air-conditioned place there's also a food centre uh nearby at raffles city which is a big convention and exhibition centre
but you know many people work there and uh they can't afford to be you know going out to markets to look for food
so at these food centres you'll get decent food local food and at affordable prices
uh huh
oh i see
i see
alright cool
um so yah um we'll book the uh hotel reservation um where um we there we can kind of settle to un
uh the place where i can get something to eat
um you know some places where i can get some you know those race souvenirs for uh a cheaper price
yah
uh i don't know about cheaper price but uh i know that during the race uh uh they do have vendors uh offer their souvenirs
um yah
hm okay
uh because in singapore we protects uh copyright so i'm not sure that you can get uh sort of like imitation of the real stuff
you won't be able to get it i don't think so
uh the market i'm talking about it doesn't have uh a website but i can describe to you what they have there
uh okay
yah
that's fine
yah that will be perfect so that i can uh easily locate it
yes
uh let me see beach road
um hm let me see
yah
oops sorry
that's okay
so those uh on the map the ones that have markings uh that look like buses those are the bus stops right
uh i can't see
the small blue ones
no i think they are attractions
they are places i don't see the key here
does it say
no it's urban development authority so it's not a bus stop okay
uh okay
okay
i see
but your market is just down the way
your hotel is where this little uh like uh exclamation mark is
okay
yup
uh huh
so you walk down here and uh at sultan gate palace we have the oldest mosque in singapore you can visit
and if you want non-souvenir uh non sorry non-race souvenirs you can do shopping along arab street
this whole area is a conservation area
and just beyond sultan gate is the market that i'm talking about
okay
oh perfect
okay
do you know um satay or kebab
are you familiar with kebab
yah
um not that really familiar with that uh place but yah
um what's that all about
it's a kebab is meat that is skewered and
oh okay
alright
so our version of it here in uh southeast asia is satay we called it s a t a y
oh okay
and here you can see the vendors they have different kinds of meats
uh these are at beach road you get the uh malay version of it with peanut sauce
and so you wouldn't be getting any pork satay you would be getting uh chicken beef and uh mutton
wow okay
are those uh spicy cause i kinda like spicy stuff
okay
if you like spicy uh there are other spicy dishes i can introduce you
these are more sweet they are usually marinated to be sweet
and the sauce is peanut sauce gravy you see the little bowl that is there
oh okay
yup uh hm. yah
and you eat it with rice that has been cooked and traditionally they used leaves to weave a little basket to cook it
but sometimes they put it in a tube and then it comes out sort of circular form and it sliced up
now you also get uh sorry you were gonna say
oh okay
i see
no nothing
i um i like what i'm seeing
yah
okay on the last picture here on the at the top can you see slices of cucumber
uh hm yup
and uh fresh onions
so if since you are travelling alone you are not gonna offend anybody that's not very sweet okay
so
i see yah
yah
right
uh so this is one of the favourite dishes uh and you can eat there
yah
yah
perfect
perfect i like this
yup
um and then um would you also be able to hook me up with some tickets for the uh flyer cause i think based on what i read um specially during the race day it's a wonderful spot where you can see the whole track right
okay
yes
uh because the flyer is located uh within view of the race track and uh the flyer is uh very slow moving
so you get uh time to soak in the view not only the race track but the surrounding area
if i am uh not mistaken it is only twenty nine dollars
wow okay
yes
i'll show you the location of it
okay cool
so can you see it here
yup
and the race track is just nearby
and uh it's also near uh the place where we book the my stay right
yes
okay perfect
uh if you uh don't mind walking you can walk there you know
it's nice to walk because uh it's by the river and it's lots of things to see and uh enjoy while you're uh doing your walk
uh
uh yah
yah
i don't really mind walking that's that would be perfect
i'm a walking sort of tourist okay
gonna show you the flyer now
yah
oh okay
okay
so you're seeing just a little bit of it at the corner there
uh this advertisement they are trying to encourage you to uh take in a tour but here there you can see
yup
oh wow
okay
you can the butler of course this one is uh not so cheap huh
fifteen dollars if you can prove you're a student but uh i don't think you're a student right
are you uh
no not anymore
uh not anymore
so marlowe i'm afraid you have to pay uh twenty nine dollars uh
oh yah
oh okay
i think that would be worth it yah
you have
uh singapore sling is a cocktail that was concocted at the raffles hotel
it's got gin angostura bitters and you know if you pay extra you can enjoy your meal or you can have uh a drink
hm okay
uh i'd like to taste the sling
yah so i think yah so you just be prepared to pay a little bit more
there are places where you can eat there
uh hm okay
uh this is wait a minute
wait
uh so this is the cocktail flight
okay
you are given the cocktail but it is not the singapore sling it's their own
i think they have created something else green in colour
because the uh singapore sling is pinkish red in colour
i see
yah
so you're looking at the capsule now
uh so this is uh how it looks like inside huh
yes that's right
so there are restaurants around the area
there is uh place where you can buy things
so
okay
hm okay
yah
so dining on the flyer i think this is chilli crab let me try and get it for you
because you say you like something hot right
okay
yah
uh one of our iconic dishes here that many people like to eat is chilli crab
oh cool
i want to try that
yah you enjoy crabs right
you don't have any allergy or anything
yup
nope
uh it is crabs cooked with chilli and uh what do you call it
um tomato sauce
and if you don't mind eating with your fingers i always recommend that it's finger licking good
wow
okay i really don't mind
um yah
so seafood paradise
there
that's where you can uh have it
oh we are getting uh sound
no it's a restaurant
we'll try and cancel this
yah that's
yah no problem
alright okay
yah
okay
we have got uh this level one is about the area where the flyer is
uh hm okay
do you want to see anything else
yah um somewhere near um or
uh somewhere i can get some drinks maybe um just to cap the night off after
oh then i recommend the raffles hotel because that is a very historic hotel
uh that is a national monument and
uh okay
oh really
so usually it's the british who know about this hotel because they were our colonial rulers before independence
but this hotel here people often go in and take photographs
uh and we have there a place called the long bar
oh okay
where the reception of the hotel is now uh it's all been changed but the long bar used to be right at the front of the hotel and it was the longest bar in the whole world at one time
wow okay
okay
but
and what do they uh do they have lots of mixes there
yes
they have lots of mixes but the people who go there uh they go for the singapore sling
hm okay
because the sling was created there at the hotel
i see
so
by their bartender
so that's uh where i can get that uh famous sling huh
yes that's right
so you're getting it uh from the place itself it's very special
you can even buy the glass to bring home
uh hm yah
i would like really
wow
yes
and they they won't sort of clean up your glass and give it to you they give you a new one uh nicely packaged
okay cool
cool that would be perfect
and then um so that would be um the itinerary for at least a day
um any other places i can visit that would uh be very interesting like um un a
i believe you have a great big zoo um somewhere um the other side i think uh
yes we have a zoo it is out of town but because of where you're staying near the uh subway station
you can take the subway and then you can connect
i see
um i heard that uh for me to be able to uh use the public transport i have to have like uh those cards um instead of paying uh cash or coins
uh yes that would be very easy
but just let me show you the zoo first because it's coming out from the screen
okay
okay cool
go
it's in the north of singapore and where the race is held is in the south of singapore
but you can connect uh to the nearest big town and there you take a bus that will bring you directly to the zoo where the few stops along uh housing areas
so it's also a good opportunity for you to see the type of housing singaporeans live in the scenery of you know the natural neighbourhoods that you see
you will not be in the business area when you take this bus that connects you uh from the uh train station to the bu
uh zoo
oh okay
cool
cause the zoo is where not many people live it is in uh a reserve that is uh to help us to collect rain water
it's next to a reservoir and that's why it is so attractive
i see
alright
yah this would be perfect
um i saw something there like a night safari is that um
yes there is also a night safari uh but you will be watching your show right
yah
uh yah
so it's either the night safari or you're gonna see your race
oh yah
so i think ah i'll watch the race first
oh yah
watch the race and either you extend the date or you come back another time for it
yah
no yah i think that would um i think i'll just visit the zoo for the day yah and then watch the races by the night
yes that's a good idea
let me just show you uh some of the attractions
sure
so what we do is we plan it so that it's not only the animal on show you get a little bit of the natural environment
this is part of uh the australian outback so we've got wallabies there
we'll go through quickly so i can tell you about the uh the card that you asked me about
cat country
don't they look loveable
yah i like this
i like it
and i think these are mousedeers huh
they are
oh okay
have you seen them before
no not really
i haven't seen them yet but that would be great if i can see them up close
yah they are very cute they are the size of uh little rats but they are actually look like deer
wow
oh okay
so it's called a mousedeer
hm that's why
i see
and the enclosure is just at the entrance so it's very near for you to see
oh okay
then we have elephants
okay
are these the ones that would spray water to you if ever you pass by or so
uh i thought you knew it more than uh i thought you did
it's i shouldn't tell you because uh actually it's during the show
uh so if you sits at a certain place you might get a little bit of a shower that's all
they don't spray at you all the time not to worry
uh okay
i see
okay cool
alright
they are they do uh the show is not doing tricks. it's just
uh the show is not doing tricks. it's just naturally they heave heavy logs in some countries so they are like work elephants
so here their mahouts which is the name of their trainer help them teach them you know how to continue doing this so that people will understand
i see okay
and here
oh so that's mahouts okay
mahouts is the name of the handler
that's i see okay
yah that's the term
these are um lemurs that you naturally have to go to madagascar to see
and the industries called fragile forest which is uh a forest area that's encased in netting
so we also have some free flight birds there and butterflies
it's a very lovely setting for photography
oh wow
wow i'd like that
i'd like that
uh i think i'll bring um my camera with a large memory for this one for this trip
yes a very large memory
so you know because animals move around and so if you uh want you can click as many as you like with them doing different things
yah
yah
yah okay
yah okay
yah
that i'd like that i'd like to see that
here we have some baboons they are hamadryas baboons
so the environment is not forest it's like hilly
they have multiplied a lot and don't be afraid if they come at you
there's a place that's uh covered and with glass
so if you don't want to see them in the open where you're protected by a mode you go to the glass covered area
and if the male baboon thinks you look like uh somebody who will court his wife he will come charging at you
oh okay
oh really
yah it's quite exciting because uh you know it's so near but you are protected by the glass so it's fun
that's nice
okay i like that
and i don't want to mess with this uh these baboons
uh sometimes no i wouldn't recommend that you do yah
yah
yah
uh so the zoo is precautious it will not uh take any risk with anybody
okay
orang-utans in the wild if you see them also don't go near them because they have very they are very strong
but once in the zoo some of them have been bred here they are singapore citizens
hm really
so uh at the breakfast show you can take photographs with them
and they're in a uh open area so they are swinging from tree to tree very near you
alright
wow okay
that would be perfect
you can also take photos with them
ah okay
cool
you will just pay a small fee
so have you seen polar bears before
not yet i would like that
so you don't have to go to a cold place and you can see the polar bear and uh still be in the equatorial area
oh yah
yah i'd like to see that
uh there's a show in the morning and you can see him catching fish and al so hitting a ball high up so they have been trained
of course they have an air-conditioned area where they can sleep if they like
this would be nice
wow
oh okay
yah i'd like this i'd like to see this yah
this is one of the handsome occupants of primate kingdom
wow
i like this picture
i hope i can take some uh picture like this
sure
uh you will be able to because in the primate kingdom again it's open but uh the animals are in separate islands so that the species do not mix
and they have uh water mode is that little islands within an area and they have trees where they can climb up and down
so over the years they have decided that well this is my house and i'm happy i won't leave it because they have uh free lodging free medical facilities
uh the only thing is they don't know how to smile at you
well that's fine as long as uh i can get uh decent pictures of them this would be fine
yes
the only thing is don't be enthusiastic and jump over if you are a long jumper
uh you shouldn't be able to get through uh because if you enter any of these uh areas then the animals are likely to be defensive because you are encroaching on their home
i won't
i won't don't worry
i just want to take pictures
uh okay
yah
so if you go you must take picture of this one it's a proboscis monkey
how different is this one uh from the other monkeys that we saw a while ago
this one is in a different environment because it comes from the forest of borneo it's very shy
i saw it for thirty seconds in its natural environment when i went over to borneo
so they gave us some and they have bred successfully
and the thing is um you see this uh nose hanging down
wow
for the male the nose grows long it hangs down and for some reason the females think the longer the nose the handsomer he is
oh okay
okay so that's how they classify who's handsome who's not
uh yes that's right
and the proboscis therefore refers to the length of the nose
hm i see
alright cool
if they are breeding at the time you may see a female with uh baby and that's really thrilling
nice
i hope they are not shy when i visit
uh no they are not shy yah
lots of tourists have taken photographs of them
i think they get used to the environment
you're not going to kidzworld so i will skip that
i see
uh hm okay
uh do you like snakes
uh are you
uh i don't want to touch them though i just want to see them
okay you just want to see them
we have a reptile garden
uh yah it's within the area where we have crocodiles uh uh monitor lizards and uh komodo dragons
if i'm not mistaken this is a komodo dragon uh normally found in some islands in indonesia
but there is also an area where you can see snakes
uh it it is fully enclosed so you choose whether you want to go in
so if you enter through the gate you'll find snakes coiled around tree trunks and you can take photographs
yah
oh yah
oh okay
okay
but they don't just drop right in front of you or right at you
no they specially select these uh snakes so the species is specially selected
so you you walk on a wooden walkway and uh so it's quite fun
suddenly you make a turn and there you have a snake right on you know nearby
uh and then you just walk out uh you enter by one gate and you enter you exit by another
okay
i see
okay pretty safe
safe very safe
uh if i can go through it anybody else can
uh yah
okay
alright
okay
uh so this is african region with lions
oh nice
i like this
yah
so even if you um don't walk you can see the lions if you just take a tram right around
the lions we have quite a few i forget how many but some of them maybe in a place that's uh good for photos yah
if not you can walk in the same area after you get off the tram and then you can uh walk and position yourself
and you must not leave the zoo without seeing this
oh nice
i like this
this is not the regular tiger this is uh special species is the white tiger
wow
and it was found years ago in india
oh that's pretty weird because i understand there are the yellow ones are more often in india
yes
uh and one day they found one that was white uh he had gene mutation and uh maharaja or the ruler he started breeding them
and then when the offspring came out you know maybe half white half yellow they it they continue to breed until they got the white gene being uh predominant
i see
nice a alright
so we have three of them
oh okay
nice
they are in an area where they have a deep pool
so sometimes you can see them swimming
oh wow
okay
besides the orang-utans these are very popular with uh tourists
yah so your camera you don't forget your camera you'll be enjoying
uh hm okay
i won't
yah that's right
so uh the zoo is really uh a must-see place i feel for people
yah
yah okay
i'll uh really want to uh go there
any other um attractions uh that i could go to um not that far away from uh the race place
okay
this zoo you have to take a train it's a little bit further away okay
so i'm going to find you other attractions
uh what are what would you consider visiting a museum or an outdoor area
um i heard you have uh universal studios
universal studios yes okay we can try and get universal studios uh and get you some pictures
this is on sentosa island it's uh not so near that you can walk
you'll have to take uh bus and also uh take a shuttle of the outside of universal studios go into sentosa island
yah
oh okay
hm okay
yah i'd like visit uh that place
so you take a bus uh from near your hotel and i think if you ask the hotel concierge they'll be able to tell you where the in fact i can tell you
you if you walk to the raffles hotel if you had your sling around the corner of raffles hotel uh facing raffles city which is the convention centre uh there's a bus number one three one and it will take you to a place called harbourfront
can you see on the map here
okay
yup uh hm
so harbourfront here
you get off the uh bu the sorry the train the bus stop in fact
and in fact if you wait there there are shuttle buses free of charge that will bring you into universal studios
okay
um okay
perfect nice
i like that
you don't have to take the sentosa bus that will cost you an extra dollar because here uh universal studios is very happy to have you uh visit them okay
okay
alright
i saw something like uh the transformers uh ride is that uh in the uh universal studios
yes uh but i'm not going to show uh all the rides
you can just see here
just a picture this is easier to see
okay yah
yup
it's uh you know if you like thrills and scares
yah i like that
okay
uh lots of places to amuse you
uh this is the transformer the ride you know you will be uh having the thrill of your life uh as you are you know uh moving around
let me just go through uh what they have here
so if rides you're interested in uh
yah
sure
yup
i am very interested with the rides
they have the battlestar galactica uh cylon
so it's a suspended roller coaster goes up around and upside down
wow
i like that
i like that
you like that
okay here's more
uh intense corkscrews and cobra roll
wow
okay i like that
i'd love to ride that uh ride after this transformers
uh okay
uh that's really fun huh
i'd go to ride after
yah
we also have uh battlestar galactica choose your side human versus cylon
and you have the you engage in the ultimate intergalactic battle between good and evil at world's tallest duelling roller coasters themed after hit tv show battlestar galactica
i see okay
i like that
and then um what else
so there are the rides yah
uh so uh it's also ancient egypt mummies and obelisk
so you are transported back uh eighty years to the nineteen thirties to the golden age of egyptian exploration
oh okay
hm okay
uh here uh you can face the wrath of the mummy on the world's first psychological thrill ride
total darkness
uh on all sides you get huge fire balls swarms of scarab beetles and an army of warrior mummies
so uh
yikes
okay
okay i like that
so it's adventure all the way for you you know
yah i know
yah i really like that
yah
okay
that's nice
uh that yes
uh i can see uh how you will be very excited because i've also been to the disneyland and um uh to the universal studios yah and really uh engaging
yah
okay
okay i think i'm gonna um book uh some tickets for uh this trip for uh in universal studios or at um gonna get some of those and then we'll um let's hook up the tickets for the zoo um a little bit later on
and then um anywhere else where i can uh get uh lots of uh nice adventure
uh i think you'll get the most adventure here already uh at universal studios
okay oh okay
okay oh okay
alright
um let me see
um any place where i can maybe get some exercise um maybe play some football
hm playing football you have to hook up with uh the local teams i don't information on that because football is played uh it's a team game right
oh okay
yah
so uh off-hand now i would not be able to tell you but uh if you asked your travel agents uh and to source for you or uh we have more time to look into the internet and we contact uh a clubs or schools that are willing to entertain you then you will be able to
but uh you will not have time i think you know because uh
i know
yah
and since uh kind of short of a trip
um i think where else should i go
um yah shopping um uh shirts any other um cause i wanna bring some souvenirs back home
um any not really race related for um maybe for the family i think
for the family uh do you want to shop at uh this resort the resorts world singapore
or do you want you know uh simpler uh souvenirs say from chinatown or from uh the shopping centres
uh i think that would be um um would that uh mean like uh those bags and shirts
yes
bags and shirt you can get in chinatown uh easily
uh yah i think that would be perfect
yah
yes
you can go down to chinatown and uh uh you'll be able to get bags and shirts very easily
uh along the street side
uh and prices are also affordable so you can buy more you know more variety
um okay
i see
so how do i get there from uh maybe from the hotel or from maybe from raffles centre
uh you can take the train from city hall station
uh hm okay
okay do you see the red line
yup okay
so beach road is just uh nearby okay
and so if you at city hall you can take let me see what's the easiest connection well either way
you can go to dhoby ghaut
um okay
okay
this is a major intersection with three lines meeting
and then you take the purple line which is the northeast line and it's just two stops down to chinatown
oh okay
okay
gotcha
okay
okay
so that's where you can get a variety of uh things to buy
alright
can i
i'll try and see if i can get you some photos uh some photos so you'll have a better idea
is that also where i can get some gadgets um uh like phones or uh tablets
uh phones or tablets phones you probably can buy i can't tell you exactly the shops but i think i've seen phone shops there
but if you're talking about information technology uh there is a centre in singapore where you have uh a lots of these shops so it would be easier for you to pick and choose down there and it is called funan centre
oh okay
yes
it's also very near to uh your hotel
okay
so let me show you funan centre
people get it products peripherals
yah that would be perfect
i like that. that's where uh singaporeans go
i like that. that's where uh singaporeans go
uh so here you are at city hall
you can in fact walk
you sound like a strong young man right
yah
uh i'd like to walk
so yes
so if you walk down uh to uh let me see if i can get the map here
oh okay
okay this is a picture of the store
uh we have buses and we have uh
i think if you don't want to walk you can take a bus
yah
okay
alright there
yes
okay
so the funan place where you can do your shopping is here and your hotel is okay to the right there
can you see uh beach centre
yah
oh that's near
yes that's near
that's why i say it's in fact walkable uh because then you can take in the sights along the way
uh you can see uh the saint andrew's cathedral which is uh historic monuments
and uh nearby uh if you divert a little bit it's the first church built in singapore that's still is uh more or less in its original form with add-ons it's called the armenian church
alright yah
oh okay
so as you walk you get to see more uh uh than you would if you uh hop up a bus
it's not very far i mean i could walk the distance yah
alright
yah i'd uh
i think uh i'd like to walk from the hotel to that place
so in the day before the race you have lots of things to occupy you yah
yah
yah i know
um hm
so there
that's one spot i could go to and then maybe chinatown and then yah those places where uh i could go
well um where else i i'm thinking of uh some other places i would like to go to
um do you what are the other attractions that you would recommend
uh i think if you are in this area and you're willing to walk you will be able to see attractions as you're walking
uh so if you walk a little bit further down here you see the singapore river
uh hm okay
so the race track is here okay uh around here
this is the singapore river
uh there are bars and restaurants here it's very scenic
and if you were to uh move down a little bit more
if you turn this way towards the marina bay it's the merlion park
um okay
okay uh i don't know if you heard of the merlion
it
um i think i've heard of that but um can you remind me again i'm sorry
but um can you remind me again i'm sorry
uh it's the first emblem of the singapore tourism board when it was started
half lion and half uh fish because we're an island
oh okay
now i remember
okay yah
uh and one of the early princes when he landed on singapore island he saw an animal so he asked what was that i saw
and someone said to him uh i heard that there's an animal called the singa singa is lion
uh but we have no lions in singapore
we have no record of lions naturally born in singapore so perhaps he saw a tiger which used to roam in our forest or a big deer yah
ah okay
yup
um i see
so this is a place many tourist like to go uh to take photographs as uh you can see some of the tourist there
uh otherwise if you then if you after you have taken your photographs you can head back along the river and uh go down towards funan
and from funan you carry on walking you will be in chinatown area
yah
uh hm okay
yah
i think i'll need to pack my sneakers
oh yes the best pair of sneakers that you have uh so you know you are comfortable
so it wouldn't hurt
yup
yes
or you can take a break every now and then along the way
stop at a coffee shop and you can have a drink that many of us enjoy
uh we do you drink coffee or tea
oh okay
um coffee tea both
um i'd like it cold though
yes cold
so uh we too like it cold
you can have it with uh evaporated milk and uh you can add ice to it so it's called uh kopi-si
can you remember that
yah i'll uh take note of that
and
or you can just tell him with ice uh yah
okay
yah they will understand
si means you're adding evaporated milk so it makes it really yummy
okay
um i see
cool
and uh that goes best with uh is it uh coffee bun
yes you can have uh bread and toast with it if you like
uh you can have a kind of jam made of coconut milk and uh sugar and pandanus leaves
are you familiar with pandanus leaves
yah uh
yah
so it's a fragrant jam that we put inside it's called kaya toast
kaya is the name of the jam
and if you like it you can buy it home as a souvenir also
yah i like that
you just have to pack it carefully
oh okay
i hope it doesn't stink inside the plane
oh no it doesn't stink in fact it's very fragrant because of the pandanus
i see
yah
so you can get it in jars like this yah
yah
okay uh hm
so we have the description there
and ya kun here is a very old uh shop with a long history and now they have opened little cafés all over singapore
it's very affordable
and they have cheese toast they have toast with uh butter and sugar with kaya
and if you want some more nutrition you can have soft boiled eggs
uh they do it perfectly
yes
in fact i just had it this morning
wow
eighty cents for one egg
okay
because i didn't want to eat too many
yah
yah
that would be perfect
yes
so uh you this is something uh local that you can try
here are some pictures of it
uh it's
uh yah
yah
wow
looks yummy
alright
if it is very hot you can settle for ice cream toast
i think that's a modern add-on
oh okay
uh the traditional is the kaya toast the one in the first picture top left
okay
okay
so if your sneakers are getting tired you can give your sneakers uh a rest
i see
i think is that the soft boiled eggs
yes that's right
and it's perfectly done really perfectly done
i cannot get it done this way
you know sometimes you get it with these transparent parts that are supposed to be white but here uh they are all white
i think it's the temperature was there water and the fact that the eggs are very fresh
right per i see
they don't tell you the secret though no don't they
uh no because if you look at the side bar here on the left can you see franchise opportunities
no
you have to pay them a lot of money to learn the secret
yikes okay
if you like pork do you like pork
yah i do
uh as you're walking in that area there is also uh pork
uh uh what we like to eat is uh pork bones in soup that you can uh try and it's also a coffee shop just down from the river near to where your stall is
i think that would be nice
yah
yah i like that
and it's got a lot of garlic inside so the garlic is also yummy
yah yummy
i like that
that's a good thing about travelling alone you don't have to worry about you know smelling stinky or your girlfriend or your companion is going to scold you
yah
hm i know
yah wow
okay
i like that
yes
so this is the chinese version further down uh they're showing you some of the ingredients
i see
um these are the um there's a spicy option on this one right
uh no this is not spicy this is garlic uh alright
um okay
oh but normally people put lots of pepper in it
oh okay
i that would be fine with me
that there yes
so it's a spicy so they normally a lot of restaurants now leave the spicy options to you so that it's optional
uh it's optional so that you can uh put it or you can not put it in
yes
um okay got it
okay
yah
alright i like this
uh any other things you'd like to know besides the shopping chinatown and uh and the food to eat
uh what else
um i think um yah i think that would be all
uh i would uh i think i have all the things that i would need alright
so i'll um get in touch again maybe uh with the bookings so that we can finalise everything
yes indeed

okay
okay

hello good afternoon uh this uh philip
uh with uh the uh participant id number fifty two
hello
hi philip my name is matthew i'm the tour guide three how can i help you today
eh uh good afternoon
uh i was uh planning a trip again to singapore er in the next few months and i was wondering if you could help me out uh with the my uh itinerary uh going there
uh yes certainly
uh firstly can i uh find out a few things uh from you first uh what are the things that er you need yah
okay
right
the first thing is um accommodation do you have anything in mind for your accommodation
uh right now uh i'm uh on a budget about uh seventy to eighty uh singapore uh dollars pe per night uh for the accommodation
uh is that okay or uh is that too low
uh in fact it's very too low
so what usually is the rates for the uh hotel or uh for the accommodation there in singapore uh matthew
um probably in a range of approximately about ninety uh to hundred and twenty dollars
oh that's very good
and that's inclusive already of breakfast or uh is it only for uh lodging
uh that is not inclusive of breakfast because usually breakfast is uh for budgeted hotel especially that you're looking at asking me about eighty to ninety dollars hundred percent you are really you will not get any breakfast
okay
for uh if
uh probably around by a hundred dollars you might be able to get one
uh no not a hundred dollar sorry hundred and twenty dollars
ah okay
hundred and twenty
and
yah
ah okay
and i'm planning to bring um my fiancé there also when i visit singapore
so uh what's the best uh place near the city to stay in
uh which what are the best place to i mean which hotel will be
yah uh that's what i mean
um uh is orchard a good place uh to to stay when i'm in singapore or uh do you have uh other things or other places that you can recommend
yah
uh orchard road will be uh a premium place and accommodation wise along orchard road will be a little bit more uh costly i will say
okay
so looking at uh a little bit far away from the city area uh will be fairly between your budget if you are looking at it
but the problem is you will have to take a look at the uh transport system nearby to the accommodation that you're gonna put up since you are on the budget travelers you have to look at uh those things uh in mind
okay
okay
yah
alright um first thing um you like um when you're in singapore what are the places that you'd like to visit
uh i heard that uh sentosa and uh universal studios are a good place to visit and uh to spend the day is that correct
uh yes indeed
ah okay
so for uh sentosa uh how much is the budget for that uh for the entrance or uh for the fee
alright
um in fact uh let's go one step at a time
firstly uh we settle your accommodation first right
okay
okay
uh for accommodation wise right now at the very moment looking at the budget we have we try to locate one hotel which is fairly uh at that kind of cheaper rate huh
alright so we look one for we look up for one hotel first right
okay
uh you are having screen sharing with me uh right now right
yup
uh i can see it
you can see huh okay
okay let me see what uh
hotel eighty one is also uh famous in singapore uh matthew right
yes
it's actually a chain of hotel
uh they have a chain of hotel in singapore all over the places
uh in fact uh many of these uh hotels chains they are very good at making budget hotel for people like
uh yah
uh huh
the budget hotels uh that's good yah
yah people like you who can travel around
okay
but uh their rooms uh is that uh is it big or uh
yah i'm going to give you uh a out view of this hotel so that you can have an idea uh what are the things you expect uh
okay
uh okay that's good
okay uh hm
yah this is
okay so how long have you been a tour guide uh matthew
um i have been a tour guide for whole past six years
oh that's lot
and
okay now let's see uh you are planning to travel in the month of uh
around uh september uh for my birthday
september
yah
september
okay
september for the yah birth birthday
okay let see the ra rates for the hotel
ah now i know why
i guess september is a little bit more costly
ah okay
so it's
uh the reason why because is because during that particular month uh there is a formula one race team will be coming here for the race so hotel
ah okay
ah okay yah
tha that's where the last week of september right for the uh f one race
uh right
so the hotel room will be a little bit more uh co
if we can make it uh august uh let's check august or october
august or october ah
uh yah
and i haven't book uh a flight yet so uh we could check those months as well
uh yah
okay let's see
let me just get to i'm trying to get the hotel near to the transport system so that you uh will definitely be able to fully enjoy your holiday
okay
um yah
yah
okay
i hope there's uh a cheap rate uh for the month of august
yah now you can see for your screen right now uh it's a lot more cheaper right
okay
yah compare to a while ago hundred seventy nine hundred eighty yah
now you get what i'm trying to put across
yah
right
uh for this hotel uh at the present moment is not inclusive of breakfast okay
but the hotel vicinity you should be able to get uh what you call breakfast easily no problem
okay
okay
okay within the vicinity
yah
um these are the some of the screenshots of the uh hotel premises you can see how the room look like
the exterior of the hotel and the guest room the bathroom and the balcony
okay
actually it's big uh since it has a balcony in a terrace
yah some of them they are having balconies
so either move a little bit downward and there you see yah
so reception of the hotel interior the entrance and the bathroom
yah
okay
okay
okay i see
and these are the facility here they have inside the hotel
uh as you can see there is wifi which is there complimentary wifi so you need not have to pay for the wifi
i can't see
okay
yah
uh laundry services usually is uh chargeable yah
twenty fourth hm. uh i don't think we will be do uh laundering in uh when we stay there or we there's a need for it but uh nevertheless it's good
at least uh they included it
uh yah
it's not included but you have to pay for that
uh you can avail of it
okay i understand now
alright
alright
uh right
so the next thing is you want to know how to get to your hotel
am i right to say that
because if you know there's a hotel like that's uh there but how to get towards that place that will be also another big problem for you
okay
okay
right
now um looking at the hotel is actually located somewhere in the city area uh that's where you can uh do your shopping if you want to it's also nearby to orchard road if you want to go
so uh you can see the blue coloured dot which is there a big circle with a bit narrow that in fact is the hotel that hotel eighty one bugis alright
okay
okay let me just check uh screen is uh loading
okay so the blue one yah
yah
yah the blue one right
so uh
okay
uh matthew for this street uh what street uh is hotel eighty one in
is it the bugis street or what specific street uh
yah
it's actually along middle road
middle road okay
yah middle road
and middle road is located in the city area itself
and of course you are very quite accessible to three uh train system here in singapore
uh one is the ew twelve
if you look onto your map that is actually uh bugis station
uh ew stands for east west bound train station twelve
okay
okay
okay
uh this this is for the uh mrt transport is this correct
correct
ah okay
now do you also like to know how to get from the airport to your hotel right
because uh budget travellers you definitely want to save uh some money for yourself
yah
uh i for the uh budget terminal is this the uh changi airport
yes but it's not budget terminal but i want to say is you are travelling on a budget so you definitely need uh you need uh a public transport to go around right
okay
right
so if you will just take a quick look at the ew eighteen you just take note about this uh ew eighteen is with bugis uh station okay
now i'm going to go to another screen that has the train system from changi airport to your hotel okay
okay
um okay
alright
so can you see the whole map of the transport system
uh it's yah right now
yah it's fully loaded already
okay
now if you were to look on to your right hand side you'll find that the changi airport is on the right hand side just on three
ah okay number three right
yes
now the changi airport has a train system the mrt station which will lead you all the way toward your hotel whereby it's near to bugis
can you see bugis on the green colour track going all the way to bugis
green
ah okay
so it's only a one ride from the airport if you're going to the uh if you're going to take the mrt
correct
it is not actually one ride but it's actually two rides which are there
ah okay
ah okay
first ride which is from changi airport you will end up in tanah merah you can see a green coloured dot which is here
now you have to switch platform in order to get the train towards bugis
on tanah merah yah
yah the white one
from tanah merah to bugis okay
alright
and if you see there is uh two white coloured dot which is here and that is to tell you that there is an interchange in between if you want to get connected onto a different rail
ah okay
for the yellow uh rail
for the yellow that we called it the circle line
circle line stands for cc yah
ah okay
okay
okay
so you are not going to use that because you're gonna go all the way green until bugis
so from the airport towards bugis that will takes you about forty to forty five minutes of train ride alright
okay
and for singa uh for getting into the train is very simple almost like the similar one uh in your place but uh the thing is in singapore here in what you need to do is you need to know the station you're going to get down
so when you go to the ticket counter you can um get the ticket for the bugis uh and you'll get your refund uh of the ticket at the ticketing counter
so uh the estimated fare will be around about two dollars sixty cents and with the deposit it will cost you three dollar and sixty alright
okay sure
okay
uh yah
uh i just want to know also for example i'll be using the train for my whole stay is there a prepaid card or a card that we could load so uh i wouldn't be uh queuing anymore on the ticket counters
yes there is a tourist pass but uh if i'm not wrong it's a fifteen dollars uh three days pass or it could have take arrive on between yah
ah okay
okay
so that's good
well of course depends on you whether you really need so much or not because you hardly use uh so much of the train can walk uh yah because you're only on two days with uh hardly spend so much yah
okay
two days yah
yah
and also matthew uh what's the uh operation hours of the train or what does uh what time does it start and what's the uh last trip for it
right
the train system starts at five thirty in the morning the last train disconnect will be at twelve midnight
ah okay
so that's uh there's a long hours of operation
okay that's good
right
correct
so if you will take the train down it will leaves you back it will leaves you to your hotel where the bugis is yah the bugis eighty one
okay
right
so at that area in fact you are located in the middle of the city and from there uh towards some of the shopping area nearby is uh walking distance
okay
uh that's good
right
so you can see uh from your hotel towards this area here called suntec city
now suntec city is one of the largest shopping mall in singapore
they have uh there is about two hundred and seventy retail shops are there
alright easily keep you occupying for the whole day in fact
and next to the suntec city
uh i will say in the suntec city itself there is a fountain which is there
that is the world largest water fountain and it's called the fountain of wealth
so if you want to catch that attraction you can also walk across towards these suntec city tower one two three and four
these towers are being surrounded the world largest water fountain
okay
okay
okay
hm okay
okay
uh yah in uh suntec matthew uh are there it shops also
cause i'm plan
uh yes
in suntec city we do have it shop
the it is known as ep centre
okay
ep centre
or otherwise you can also take a train down towards the funan it mall that's where you can pick up some of the latest electronic gadget
ah okay
right
that's good
okay so i guess we're settled with the uh accommodation with hotel eighty one uh in the in middle road
so uh what other things that uh can you suggest uh for me
what other uh tourist spots that i can visit when i when we visit there matthew
right
uh looking at your vicinity uh you are also located quite near to waterloo street
the waterloo street is another uh nice spot for tourist uh specially visiting the uh waterloo street temple
alright i'm blowing this thing up for you to let you have a look at the waterloo street yah
okay
okay
now if you were to look on to your right hand side this is your hotel
right
and we have the national library next to us and further up you got uh stamford centre and of course uh next to the stamford centre we have the uh kwan im temple which is one of the oldest temple here and along the street
and next to the temple there is also a hindu temple which is also a very heritage uh temple yah
okay
okay
so in fact uh you are also able to get access into our hawker centre
this hawker centre in fact is referring to food court
uh it's non-air conditioner so we call it hawker centre
okay
oh so it's an open space uh it's an open space right
uh no it's not an open space it's sheltered but the thing is um it's non-air conditioner
ah okay i get uh
uh each individual stall are selling their food but you are if you want you can go towards the stall and see what they are selling and then you can order from them and pick up your food from the stall holders and you can after they have make the meal they will bring it back to your um uh seats uh to get your meal yah
okay
oh yah
and uh for here matthew uh what's the budget uh for each meal
right
you can estimate yourself if you you are not a vegetarian aren't you
uh no
alright good
now if it's not a vegetarian then why it is not an issue because most of the food here uh if you were to go to a hawker centre estimated per meal will cost you around about six dollars
comfortably you can have one good meal with a cup of soft drink
okay
yah
i heard from a friend that uh a good um how do you call it
it's a restaurant it's the uh al uh although a in singapore uh for the steam chicken
you're referring to our local favourite dishes right
yah
yah
now the local favourite dishes is known as hainanese chicken rice
hainanese chicken rice yah
ah okay
yah uh hainanese chicken rice
now the hainanese chicken rice in fact is also located very near uh to your hotel if you want to try the hainanese chicken rice
alright let's scroll a little bit up here
um you can see that your hotel is located here at bugis
now two street across the road you can see can you see bugis street and seah street
yah the blue one yah
let me just check it still loading
okay there you go
can you see bugis street and seah street
yah
now bugis street are very famous for the duck
we have uh what you call black sauce duck
and seah street are very popular for it's chicken
okay
okay
yah
so hainanese chicken rice uh in fact once generated from that particular street
ah okay
uh so okay
yah
so you can get the traditional hainanese chicken rice from there
and the cost of it uh how much
the cost of the chicken rice if it's your normal dishes will probably cost you around about three fifty
ah okay
so that's cheap yah
yah
so if you order another cup of drinks probably about a dollar plus and then makes about to four dollar five dollars per meal
okay that's good
at least uh yah like what you said a while ago uh we won't be having a difficult time in getting food uh within the vicinity
correct
ah okay
okay
going back to our um uh to the placesthat uh we can visit while we are there matthew
alright
now i guess you have uh just now asked me about universal studio right
yah that's the uh
yes everybody are very keen on universal studio
i think they just opened last year two thousand eleven or two thousand ten matthew
two years back
ah okay
two year they open two years back and um they have recently la uh this year they add-in a few more rides which are there
and now first thing is you want to know how to get there right
yah uh from bugis
alright
now from bugis the direction towards that place there are a few option
one you can take the train system towards uh the universal studio on your own
uh two you can take a bus uh towards the harbourfront okay
now i'm gonna just show it to you how you're gonna move around from your hotel to universal studio huh
okay
yah okay
alright
now you can see uh on your screen uh right there you have public buses
okay
now the public buses you can pick it up from your near to your hotel is bus number one hundred
okay
now that bus will take you all the way towards harbourfront
harbourfront which is uh one of the uh place whereby you can take the sky to the what you call sentosa express to the um universal studio
okay so you have to take note that it's bus number one hundred okay
oh to okay
universal studio okay
okay
is universal studio also near um uh sentosa
i'm sorry
is universal studio also near sentosa
uh yes universal studio in fact is located inside sentosa
ah okay
yah
so we're hitting two birds in one stone when uh we visit
correct
so if you are going to sentosa and universal studio you can uh pick it out from there
okay
so at least for the whole day uh we can visit to uh vicinities
two place
yah two places already
okay let me see whether i can pick up those
uh what other rides were added uh this year uh in universal studios matthew
uh one of the newest one is the transformer
ah okay
yah you shouldn't miss that transformer
have you uh try the ride already
yes i tried the ride myself it's very interesting and of course that also depends on individual
you are you having uh you are physically fit i guess so
yah
uh i like uh trying the rides uh in uh any theme parks as well
alright
so i guess uh that is the bus number you can take towards vivocity to get your ride on to sentosa express to universal studio
okay
now the other way is you can also pick up some um free shuttle buses
the free shuttle buses is only available at certain location
alright uh the place where you are staying right now that you are staying will be at uh the bugis it's quite near to swiss the stamford hotel
okay
okay
now swiss the stamford hotel is not far away from your hotel but you will have to take note about the timing for the free shuttle bus
we uh say free shuttle bus means uh provided if you have your passport with you to prove that you are a visitor is singapore you can get a free ride on this shuttle bus okay
now swiss the stamford hotel just take note this first and i will show you the location of the swiss the stamford hotel uh right now
okay yah
now take a look on the map it's coming up right now on your screen
right can you see your hotel
okay let me s
okay
yup
alright
now can you see this hotel here
what's the speci uh the fairmont uh okay
swissotel the stanford yah
correct
so this is the location where you can pick up the free shuttle bus
okay
alright
you have to walk from your hotel all the way to this hotel here to pick up the free rides or the free shuttle service to the universal studio
okay
alright
so this is your transportation part
now there is the second way that you can go
obviously you like to know um how much is gonna cost you for the ticket for the admission am i right to say that
yah
yah
absolutely
i guess so huh
everybody are very keen on what their budget
budget
yah
okay let me pull out the other screen for you and i'll show you how to get your ticket
um okay
now i'm gonna pull out a chart right now
a chart whereby the universal studio two thousand and twelve calendar
okay
alright
you can see the calendar right now on your page
let me waiting for it
uh all i can see right now is just the map and now it's getting to resorts world sentosa
not okay there we go
two thousand twelve calendar yah
yah
correct
now the two thousand and twelve calendar is the calendar which shows you about the uh ticket price to universal studio
since you are travelling in the month of august you'll find that a lot of them are in orange in colour that means that is non-peak
but the one which is green in colour that is peak because it's during the weekend
so of course weekend rate will be a lot more costly compare to the non-weekend yah
now if you're going during the non-peak you'll find that the adult ticket is actually sixty eight dollars
okay
okay that's good
oh weekends
yah
okay
on the left yah sixty eight dollars
sixty eight fifty for child and senior thirty
yah
alright
then of course if you have two person is going then you have the one twenty one thirty six yah
and of course you can see that there is an express pass at thirty dollars
okay
yah what does that mean
uh what is that for
now the express pass actually pays on top of your uh normal admission
the express pass actually helps you to ease the long waiting queue time on any of the rides or attractions or movies alright
yah
okay
so for ex okay uh if i get this correct so i'll be uh for non-peak that's sixty eight then if i just wanted uh to ride everything without uh queuing up i just need to to add uh thirty dollars is that correct
uh yes i will not say no queuing up but on a shorter queue
ah okay
on a shorter queue yah
so you pay thirty dollars just to get away from getting uh queuing up
along
yah along and wasting your time in the uh queuing up for the rides yah
okay
right
so this is how the price are being range okay
it's alright
yah
and uh if i may ask matthew um for april let me uh let me oh can we go back to the uh calendar
yah i'm at the calendar
okay right
i think it's still loading okay
for the month of june and july uh it's almost at the peak season uh why is this
now because uh starting from may the twenty sixth onward it's actually a school holiday
ah okay
uh that's ma
it's a school holiday in singapore
the children the school children has one month of this school holiday
they made as year school holidays
so it's like the uh summer vacation
correct
so that is the reason why this is a full green and a full rate
ah okay
okay
okay now i know
now and the full rate has carry another meaning for it
the full rate means that is super peak and you probably might not be able to get a ticket if you do not go one month in advance
uh ahead of time okay
yah
so that is the meaning of this super peak
and there is also um a crowds management or crowds capacities are limited inside the universal studio
especially during the peak and the super peak uh they only allow about eight thousand visitors inside the universal studio
the
super peak yah
um okay
so i guess the super peak dates are uh singapore holidays
uh yes in fact right
okay
so if you want to get in around that time then probably you have to pay a lot more like the super peak is seventy four you have to add another fifty you get about hundred and twenty four
um yah
oh that's costly already yah
uh yah
a little bit costly would be on the budget huh
okay
alright
now coming back i think you would like to know uh what is there to offer you inside universal studio
okay
now this is another screen which is gonna come up into your computer and this in fact is the whole area of the universal studio
the whole universal studio is of is been designed in this manner
uh yes
so i saw there that's uh explore the seven zones right
yah exploring the seven zones yah
and this seven zones compresses of rides movies uh actions alright uh and also restaurant as well
so depends on you
ah okay
action
yah
i think i saw one interesting the sci-fi city
sci-fi city
okay we go to sci-fi city
yah
uh that's a roller coaster ride right
now yes indeed it is a roller coaster ride
you can see the uh blue and you can also see the red
the red o yah
now both of the stripes is known as battlestar galactica
ah okay battlestar okay
yah battlestar galactica
you have you watch the movie battlestar galactica
yah i have
okay
now just before the pilot got into the aircraft what did they do
okay
what did they do
which is for the uh i think there was a uh
before they got onto the aircraft they were supposed to sit onto uh a
yah
the there was a chase scene right there
yah a chasing ride right
yah
so that chasing ride has actually put onto this sci-fi centre which we call the battlestar galactica cylon human versus cylon
we call it human versus cylon is because both of this roller coaster will start simultaneously at the same time
so they are actually challenging their speed with one another crisscross uh cutting across one another and you the whole duration is only about one minute of the ride
okay
okay
okay that's fast
but i think
uh that's fast
the speed of the roller coaster is at eighty two point eight kilometres per hour
wow that's really fast
i uh that's it
if you are seating in car you don't feel anything but if you are flying outside then you definitely feel a lot of impact
okay yah
i mean it's open air and
then
then we have the transformer here
uh we you have you seen the movie called transformer right
alright
this transformer is very new in universal studio and it actually give you a feeling that you are in the automist uh fighting battles against the um uh the bad guys huh
oh decepticons yah
so if yah decepticons yah
so
so it's a three d uh type of ride
it's a three d in fact yes
you are supposed to wear the glasses and of course uh the rides will take you up and down fronting turning swinging it's very interesting
that is one of the best i will say so far
ah okay
how many uh minutes does the uh the ride usually last or the duration of it
uh usually it takes about five minutes and above
oh that's long
a long but good and fun
yah
right
uh so this is um
okay
human
right
okay
uh with uh inside the universal studio are they strict in smoking also
uh smoking is prohibited at most of the sheltered area
okay
but uh do we have designated areas for smoking inside universal
so uh no we don't have any smoking area inside universal studio
uh you can't if it's too tempting you cannot uh smoke
uh okay
uh okay
then you should stay in singapore you'll be quit uh smoking
yah that's what i heard
okay
now uh this is universal studio
so uh if you have done this universal studio and you have some more time uh another place that you that i would like to recommend you is to go to sentosa
okay
now inside this sentosa is um only uh a train ride of uh two station away from uh the universal studio alright
uh okay
okay
now uh one of the uh most exciting area that i will like you to go is to visit the song of the sea in the evening because the minute once you are done with universal studio uh you would should be around about six to seven p.m. right
and since you have the time you should uh make your way to sentosa and visit this song of the sea uh which is the show is happening at seven forty and eight forty daily alright
e uh
okay
how to get there is to take the sentosa express from the universal studio two stops away and it will lead you to beach station
and at beach station you can pick up the ticket at the ticketing counter
universal studio
okay
ah okay
so i
it's only ten dollars per person you can pick it up from there
okay
right
so that will cover your full day in uh sentosa
and okay
right
then uh the other thing is uh on the second day itself if you have time probably you like to do the uh shopping uh the
yah what uh establishment or uh what if
yah
or you can also you know take a walk down uh to our historical sites where uh the esplanade park is
you can see the esplanade park uh
yah i saw in the map that it's near uh the hotel
yes it's near to the hotel so walking distance and you can also see the esplanade theatre on the bay
um if i reduce the size a little bit and you probably will be able to see that you are also quite near to the merlion park
yah please
also be okay
i heard that uh marina bay is also a good place uh to check out uh because uh i heard from a friend that uh it's near the um race track of the f one
right
ye uh yes marina bay is marina bay sands is quite near to the racing track of the formula one it's not in front of the racing track
okay i remember
yah
so if you want to see marina bay sand then i'm viewing you this
yah
right
uh it's coming up onto your screen right now
yah
and this is marina bay sand
now marina bay sand is also not very far away from your hotel
so let me just show it to you where is the marina bay sand
now if you see from your hotel towards the marina bay sand is not far away the blue one towards this one here okay
ah okay that's good
and if you want to go to marina bay sand you can also take the circle line which is quite near to your hotel
yah
yah marina bay
you can see cc three here
you take this cc three here it will lead you to cc four then there is another entra there is another train system near to marina bay sand here
okay
yah
so it's quite nearby um to the train system you can see
i just let you have a look again huh you can see cc four right
can you see cc four
yah uh ya
cc four promenade
okay
now i'm going to go to the other screen uh where the train system is
just now when you see cc four promenade
yah
this is promenade on your screen
that means ah okay
and from promenade to bayfront which is the marina bay sand this is the stop so one stop away
okay
okay
okay
so it's quite nearby accessible by train near to your hotel
okay
alright
so i got to blow these thing a little bit up
okay
and uh how is the traffic in uh singapore uh matthew
how is the traffic
yah uh do we uh for example if rush hour so what time we uh
okay
the peak hour is usually starts from uh morning at around about seven thirty and then around about nine thirty a.m. then the second peak hour will start at uh five in the evening it will end at around about nine thirty

hello
hello good afternoon
good afternoon
hi i'm carla
i'm participant number fifty three
hi carla
my uh i am tour guide number three
okay
how can i help you today
uh alright
wait a minute tour guide number three
um i just wanna check out um some things that i can do cause i'm planning to go to um singapore maybe first week of april because it's a holiday in the philippines during that time
so um aside from the activities
well um let me just tell you by the way that i only have um a thousand singapore dollars for this trip
so
okay
oh sorry i didn't catch your name
so you ha my name is mathew
okay
hey mathew how is it going
so um uh yah
again i need to go to singapore first week of april
uh my cash is only a thousand singapore dollars and i need to know um maybe top five things that i should do in singapore
it has to be really enjoyable okay
okay
now uh before i actually uh plan the thing for you a few things that i need to ask uh from you
that is number one uh in singapore itself what are the things that you like to see most
you like to do a little bit more shopping you prefer to go to theme park or you prefer to uh see more nature
uh huh
uh huh
uh huh
oh okay
because in singapore itself it's very famous for its garden in the city
in fact the gar we call it a garden in the city
garden
uh huh
and or you can also call it city in the garden
so um in fact uh nature is one of the uh best thing that we try to put up uh in our the whole island of singapore yah
so that depends on you where you what aim uh makes you interest more
what you like to see more in singapore
so i can plan it accordingly
okay
alright
so um for you to plan accordingly i think i also gotta tell you that i've been to singapore maybe two years ago
and um
alright
yah the trip was nice
uh but the places i mostly went to were theme parks like of course we have the universal studio and um i went to um i don't know
there's this one place that is similar to ocean park it's in sentosa
what do you call that place
okay uh the sentosa right
uh yah
uh i went there and i went to this some sort of big aquarium
i forgot what to call it
yah
uh underwater world
oh the yah
been there and i went to jurong park
okay
and i yah
and yah i also i already mentioned um universal studios
but this time around um mathew i wanna check out what single ladies could do in singapore um in april cause i'm going there with my friends two of my lady friends
um so i don't think that they would enjoy nature parks
so for the thing that i wanna do i do wanna check out the nightlife
yah
oh the nightlife
yah
okay
i wanna check out the nightlife
and uh i wanna try out some good food
but the thing about good food is that um please do not um refer to me a restaurant that serves fatty foods because i've just had this operation
so get rid of those restaurants okay
yah and i'm on the budget mathew
i only have like a thousand singapore dollars
okay
alright
huh so based on the information i gathered from you uh i guess you ne you won't be going back to sentosa you will not be going back to universal studio you will not be going to jurong bird park right
yah
uh huh
yes
okay now uh there is a hotel which is quite uh nearby to what i think you might like but of course i would like to highlight to you that this hotel is located somewhere near to little india
okay why
okay
why huh
is it because it's cheap
uh not only that
but the hotels looks slightly better compare to uh the rest of the hotel especially two ladies uh you are travelling on your own or you're travelling with somebody else
oh i'm travelling with two other ladies who are single i might add
yes
oh two other ladies
i think that's okay
so i guess uh this hotel here called hotel fragrance at selegie will be a nice place uh to put up alright
uh huh
oh okay
yah
now let me just uh show you the hotel first huh
right
oh no
oh why oh no
you see ah okay there you are
coming back
so you are coming
uh you are visiting singapore in a month of when
i uh yes
which month was that
oh i'm sorry
which month you do plan to come to singapore
which manner
which month
which month
oh which month
i'm sorry
yah
yes
um first week april probably april um oh that's gonna be next week right
april five six and seven
five si you only have five and six right
you pi five yah
oh yes two days
okay two days
and let us check out the rates on the fifth first yah
okay
right
you need so here we are
we have the hotel rooms rate at one zero five
alright
and there's only three rooms left now
three rooms left
yup
oh okay
right
now this hotel uh the facility wise as you can see while i'm scrolling down
uh huh
you can see the exterior of the hotel it looks very pleasant
yes
the reception is good
there is also a swimming pool out there paying such a one zero five per room per night
if you have a swimming pool you should be very happy because um none of the hotel at this kind of rate will give you a swimming pool
uh huh
oh okay
but it's kinda tight though for the swimming pool
uh what the capacity of uh the swimming pool part
alright
okay um probably around about a hundred uh swimmers maybe
just looking as to the pool
at the same time
a hundred swimmers at the same time huh
soak in the
okay well then
soak in the pool i never say can swim around huh
oh okay
right
as you can see the facilities uh for the hotel uh uh there's a coffee shops which are there
uh of course the coffee shops of course er your hotel rooms are not inclusive of the breakfast
uh huh
so breakfast you can either pick it up from the hotel on a separate basis
or you can also try our local breakfast which is available uh next to the hotel we call it coffee shop
usually uh to have the breakfast at the coffee shop is a lot more cheaper compared to having a breakfast in the hotel
uh huh
uh huh
at the hotel
yes
oh yah cool
so um is the coffee shop some of sort of a restaurant or is it like a kiosk
uh the coffee shop refers in the hotel is actually something like a small restaurant
uh if you wanna take a look i will pull it this thing up
you can see uh down up on your screen uh there is the restaurant which is there
that is what we call the normal coffee shop in the hotel
but uh coffee shops outside the hotel is a bit different
uh let me just pull out uh some scene of the coffee shop in singapore and let you have an idea of what the coffee shops we are talking about yah
oh okay
yes
uh huh
oh okay wait
um hold up mathew
yah
i gotta know how much is it's one hundred five for two days stay in this hotel
oh is it yah
hundred and five for per day it's not for
ah okay
am i gonna get the superior room with one big bed or the twin room
okay now for
uh for one zero five
for one zero five your room is like for two person
that means that for tw yah
yah
for two pip
uh oh so i need to kick out one of my friends huh
so that's why
so you have to add one more room you don't kick out him
or maybe there's another way
you can make him you can make the additional person sleep on the floor
okay
so uh i'm oh they're gonna allow that
no i didn't say that you assumed
okay
we're just gonna probably toss coin right
or um yah
okay or we can take turns
yah
but um i need to make sure um mathew if they're gonna allow three ladies occupy one room
uh i re i guess this you better check it out with the hotel itself
because there's a re you can see from here on your screen that the bed type can be either one queen sized bed or two single bedded
subject to request availability of the hotel
say if you ask for a queen sized bed probably three person can squeeze in
ah okay
uh huh
yes
uh huh
but uh
okay
uh that
or i can get in a fight with her today so that i won't have to bring her along with us right
yah okay
i think we could do the negotiations once we get there
yah or the other one can get uh one more additional room
uh huh
oh i'm travelling on a really tight budget
but um then you take turn to sleep on a bigger bed
okay is this the cheapest um i could get
uh yes i would say because you can see that uh you were not be able to get such a good hotel rate
i can show you some other hotel as well but you will find that the hotel is a lot more um expensive compare to this one yah
how does it
yes
oh okay
so a cheaper hotel than this wouldn't look really presentable right
either hm yup
probably just fan not air-conditioned in singapore
oh no
oh no
okay let me see what i can get
i pull out another hotel which is um near to that particular area and you can see uh from here the rate how much it's gonna be
yah
where is this at
it's near where
huh
it's right
oh it's in bugis
yah
it's where the cheapest stuff are right
uh yes
i'm putting you up near to the area
cause i'm a really cheap lady you see
uh not cheap lady but you're smarter in controlling your budget yah
yes
here you see
you can see down here how much is gonna be
oh hundred and twenty seven
okay
yah compare to the one that is there
how much is gonna cost you
uh that's just one zero five and i just simply have to kick out one of my friends right
uh same thing uh to that particular hotel you still have to kick him out
uh yes
okay that's a hundred five
okay before we go to the coffee shop i'm concerned about um the transportation
um as to how what how cheap is the transpo
is it accessible
i mean is it near the bus stops
right
the fragrance hotel
okay now so we first go for the fragrance hotel yah
yes
now
i don't think we can go to the other one cause it's um a lot more expensive right
okay so we go for this one
by now i'm gonna show you where is it located so that you have an idea what i'm gonna talk to you about alright
okay
right
okay
alright
right
so if you see on your map right now you will find that the hotel which you are gonna put up will be fragrance hotel at selegie
uh huh
and this is not far away from bugis
oh okay
okay
alright
and you can see there are two trains uh network uh located nearby to the hotel
one of the train is called the little india which is a northeast train
uh huh
okay
station number seven
oh alright
you can see the magenta in colour right
that is the northeast line
and the other line is actually the ew twelve which is uh located at bugis
bugis
alright
okay
so you have been to bugis right
yes been there
okay now good
so and since you are a budget travellers you probably would like to do a little bit of using our local transport system to travel to the places you want to go right
uh which is cheaper train or bus
well buses will take a little bit longer time
but train system will be a lot more comfortable because you get to enjoy the view good view uh while you are taking the train ride yah
uh huh
uh huh
oh yes
right
but where do i get to where can i get those cards
ah don't worry i'm going to go step-by-step for you
wow okay cool
wow okay cool
now you can see that the hotel is here and the train system ew twelve
i want you to take a look carefully at ew twelve
okay
but ew twelve is actually bugis right
uh huh
it's the bugis station
now i'm gonna go to another screen where the train network system is alright
uh huh
yes
alright
can you see the train system network now
uh not yet it's still loading i guess
still nothing
okay there you go
yah
now you can see uh the whole train network system here
uh huh
from changi airport that's where the international airport is
uh huh
where you gonna land uh when you are coming
yes
so from there the changi airport you will have to take the train which is the east-west train
so that's why we call it ew uh ew
oh that's why okay
it's the green line right
so you yah
yes it's the green line you remember
oh yes
i asked you to take a look at bugis
uh huh
okay you locate the bugis along that green track
uh huh
right
now if you'll gonna take the train system from changi airport you probably will have to end-up at this station called tanah merah which is two stops away from the changi airport
uh huh
yes
now you have to go across the platform to uh switch the train towards all the way to bugis
okay
when you end-up in bugis uh the fare will be approximately about two dollars and sixty cents
per person
on top of that you'll probably will have to pay additional of one dollar extra for the deposit of the ticket
the minute when you reach your destination you can get your refund on the deposit of the ticket by putting the ticket into the machine
it will get to the refund
uh huh
okay
alright
alright
right
so you will end up at bugis
so right now i'm gonna go back to bugis alright
so on your map again you can see ew twelve which is the bugis station
oh just a minute it's not yet loading
okay there
yah
so from the bugis station towards your hotel it's gonna be about fifteen ten to fifteen minutes walk
uh huh
uh huh
but if you don't want to you wish to take a bus you can always take out the bus which is uh on the map you can see some small little blue dot which are there
ah yah
those are bus stops
you can take up any of the buses along the way which is heading toward bukit timah
so bukit timah from rochor road all the way to bukit timah this will be the stop you're gonna get down and walk towards your hotel nearby
oh okay yes
quite nearby yah
yes
so this is one way you can get to your hotel and also uh the easiest way to move around
right
so getting to your hotel not a problem
okay
so going to little india will not be a problem for you as well because your hotel is located near to little india
you can see that the serangoon road is here
this serangoon road is the whole area here is known as little india
the street which has a lot uh selling a lot of indian ornament and accessories
uh huh
i think your ladies friends will like uh to shop along the street as well
uh now this street is very popular for it's uh the indian uh what you call uh decoration item
you can uh also pick it up from there yah
oh okay
um but um which goods are cheaper at
uh little india or bugis
so that depends on what you want
in little india mainly cater for the indian taste
okay
right and bugis is asia
so if you have to move towards bugis you'll find that uh a lot of things you can pick it up at bugis junction at bugis village
uh huh
okay
right
so we have the
oh so the chocolates are found in little india at little india i mean right
chocolates
really cheap chocolates
yah
sorry
chocolates
well the along the way towards uh the bugis uh you can see there's uh road name call middle road
okay you see my mouse here
yes
yah there is middle road which is there
uh huh
now this middle road uh there is a building called gsm building
gsm you know the cell phone gsm
oh yah
yah they and the gsm building there is a chocolate uh what you call showroom uh sells a lot of chocolates yah
okay
so you can see uh let me just pull a little bit up
okay right
so you can see your hotel now
okay if you were to look downwards onto the um uh this street here middle road you'll find that fortune centre is here
next to fortune centre is where uh the chocolate factory is
the chocolate showroom is
you can pick up some more chocolates here
okay
yah
so it's quite nearby and not only that
uh you are also located whereby you can find lots of uh heritage temple heritage uh what they call uh heritage land site here
you can see this one here that i put mouse here the guan yim temple
the guan yin temple is another temple which is at the uh we call it a buddhist temple
you can visit there
uh and if you like uh arts uh we have the stamford art centre showcase various kind of performing arts there
oh okay so we can probably do those in the morning right
yah
yes indeed
that wou
okay
because now nearby to your hotel there is a food court or we call it a hawker centre available also
so you were to walk from your hotel towards this area where the uh guan yin temple is
there is albert centre here
there is a lots of uh local uh food stall where you can find slightly better and cheaper uh meal you can get uh from the hawker centre
so do must be right
uh huh
uh huh
okay
alright
yes okay
so uh mathew i hope you don't mind if i go back to the reason why i tried to call you today
i gotta know the top five things that me and girls can do mostly at night
at night
cause
alright
yes
alright
so uh let's plan my two-day travel now
now i may yah so alright
so the hotel wise you can see uh nearby is the ne seven
alright the train six sev ne seven which is little india
now the place for the nightlife is called clarke quay
uh huh
oh yah
clarke quay
you know clarke quay right
yah we went there but since i was with my brother uh we just went out
and um have dinner at shazir i forgot the name of the restaurant
shazir something like that
um it's a mediterranean food i think or no palestinian food i'm not sure
okay
so this time around we wanna get drunk
so where should we go
so clarke quay is actually a nice place to visit during the night time
uh huh
and of course there's a lot of seafood uh there are live bands along the river bend
uh you can also enjoy yourself with couple of cans of beer uh along the bridge you know
uh those are the few places that you can go to clarke quay and spent the night with
even though if you are slightly early probably you can catch our magician shows at the clarke quay called uh the arena yah
the arena at the clarke quay yah
okay
so uh let me just pull this thing out for you
is it there yet
uh no it's not coming
let me just get the right one
okay
there is noti
it's not there huh
yah it's not there
i can only remember uh what restaurant aside from shazir i'm not even sure if that's the name of the resto
um i think the hooters in clarke quay right
hm yes
that's mostly for boys
right
where is it at
uh it's not having the right map for the clarke quay
let me see whether another one i can get
uh there are many of the restaurants which are located there
uh if you click on google you can find it
but i think is uh i'm trying to get the one which is uh having the map of the clarke quay
uh huh
oh yes
it's just one trip anyway right
clarke quay
right
yah correct
so you in fact you can uh be the you can go there by uh transportation through the mrt station
the ne seven
uh let me then show you where i can where you can go from here yah
alright now you can see uh on the screen right now uh little india very near to your hotel right
yes
uh huh
uh huh
yup
right
now from little india if you were to take down the train all the way down to dhoby ghaut then to clarke quay
can you see clarke quay there
uh no where is it at
oh there you go
got it
yah
got it
uh it's quite near
now yah
yah it's quite near
so you see the thing is if you choose the right hotel uh going from one place to another is quite easy
but uh you also have to bear in mind that the train system only operates at five thirty in the morning and the last train leave the terminal would be at twelve midnight
yes
right
oh really
we won't get drunk until twelve
so there is cab right
is it like okay
so you know clarke quay
yes the cab
but the cab will charge you an additional surcharge of fifty per cent more
i know
yah if it's midnight
okay
we can walk
is it safe to walk
well it's quite safe to walk but then the thing is uh you ha if you are drunk then uh i advise you not
i agree
good call mathew
that's right
so you can see uh from here i'm putting it up the screen it um reduce the screen a little bit and i try to pull this thing up here and you can so that you can see clarke quay
alright
huh
oh okay
yah
uh the hotel is here the clarke quay
yes it's a little bit uh is it doesn't comes into the map
yes
yah it doesn't comes into the map
so anyway uh the train system that you gonna get down is at clarke quay right
i uh huh
so you can see this is clarke quay uh train station
can you see clarke quay train station
hm can you try to point it out
oh the okay ne five right
here
now ne five right
got it
now um from clarke quay uh station you can just walk down towards this river bank and i guess this bridge will a lot uh more popular to you right
because this is the kingsbridge whereby lots of the uh people will be drinking bottles or cans of beer at that time using this bridge
so it's pretty nice uh place to be
uh but of course to walk back is a little bit uh not advisable huh
yes
yes
okay
yes we might end-up sleeping in the kerb right
yes
hopefully not
yes
so best way is that if you want to back after the midnight you probably you can uh try to take a cab and there will yah
okay
alright
so i still need to get one at least one name of restaurant or club in the clarke quay's trip
i'm pretty sure you've been there so you could probably recommend one at least
so uh usually i'll go for shanghai dolly
shanghai dolly
okay what should i expect from that place
shanghai the yah
i know in fact um it's pub has a dancing um you know dancing floor
you can drink you can listen to lo
how much should i um what's that
how much do you think are we gonna spend in this place
how about uh well that depends on what li uh what drinks you are ordering
um let say jägermeister
is that too specific
okay let's try beer
fine
right
for example if you're going for during the happy hour
uh probably you'll buy one you'll get the next one for free
that start before nine
oh really
okay what time is the happy hour
so you have to be there before nine
yah befo seven to nine
what time is the happy hour
seven to nine
so if i ordered drinks um during happy hour i get what for free
yes
one for one
oh cool
cool
so you uh er if you order a jug of beer you'll get another jug of beer free
so
uh huh
okay
yah order
and that's so that means before twelve o'clock before the wee we're yah before nine we should get drunk and we should go home because
we're gonna lose the train right
before nine
no now before twelve you have
oh my god
okay
that's too early to get drunk
so um here you know here in the philippines we usually eat something with the beer or with whatever alcohol we're having
huh
yah or otherwise there is a nice place called the forbidden city
how about you guys
oh tempting
okay
tempting huh
alright this uh in fact this forbidden city let me just give you the forbidden city here
yah
yah forbidden city
uh forbidden city
alright forbidden city at clarke quay
indochine yah
here
so this in fact uh the forbidden city known as indochine and it's coming up on to your screen now
you can see the party which is happening at indochine
you can also have your meal first then you have drink then you party
oh everything is there huh
well yah
you can see nig
oh this doesn't look cheap to me
how much is it to uh get drunk in this place
well about uh hundred and fifty dollars i think you should be able to make it for you
but if you want to if you wanna have food there then of course it's probably gonna be about
hundred and fifty dollars
oh i visit the i'm gonna eat out at what's that
lucky plaza first and then we go here to get drunk right
so we should be full before getting to this place
okay
so a hundred and fifty dollars how many uh cups or how many cans of beer or wine whatever you call it can we consume
as i say you can always go during the happy hour uh and pick it up the what you call the drinks before that time
uh huh
uh that will be a lot more cheaper
okay seven to nine drink and then nine onwards just dance like crazy right
no because your order from between seven to nine you'll get to you have your drinks on your table
and that doesn't mean say you should finish it before that time
you can leave it after that time
oh okay i got that
so you order a drink first and for that time they will serve you the drinks but you don't finish it up
you take your time to finish enjoy the meal music enjoy the dance
that should be good enough for you
uh huh
huh
oh okay
alright
got it
so we have one i think we have two you've given me two restaurants
we have shanghai um dolly right
is it dolly or deli
yes dolly
okay shanghai dolly and then this one's indochine
dol
okay
so i think you've pretty much covered two nights
we could probably go to shanghai dolly once and then one night and then indochine the other right
yah or otherwise if you like more rocks and pops then you probably have to go to saint james powerstation
where is that at
now that is why quite near to the sentosa island and if you were to take the train towards uh that area uh leads you to saint james powerstation which is um you can take the same train from your little india from your hotel to this
uh i just give you the
uh huh
okay
uh wait
okay
saint james powerstation
we call it saint james powerhouse yah
hm okay
then right
saint james powerhouse also have shanghai dolly
so
this is at another um what's this
another place right
saint james living room five why
yah
okay
there is too much going on in this website that it doesn't load
uh now you see
yes i can see it
yah
now you can see the party time
oh i can see ladies free entry daily huh
yes
oh hip hop
so these are more to hip hops and raps
uh huh
uh you know
uh huh
so if you are going to saint james powerstation then you get to enjoy uh three discothèque with one admission fees
okay
one admission fee how much is that
right
about uh uh twenty five dollars
and the first drink is free
okay that's cheap
yah
twenty five dollars okay
yah
so this is i think this would be for the younger crowd right
or me i'm ju
not only for the younger crowds and it is also for middle age
you can see that there are some other parts are there
not really meant for the youngers you see
you can see that uh the party time which is there
these are not
it's pretty wild
yah
party's really wild
oh there is someone who's uh there's people performing right
so it's not just
correct
that's right there's uh yes
there's a live band you know
so it give you a variety of choice for you to choose from
so that if you don't like this pub uh now you can go the other pub behind it without paying any cover charge
okay
yes
oh really
yah so that's why
so what do you there
and so let say for example if you are now enjoying yourself in a uh pop pub right now uh the dancing
then you find it uh too much of the pounding i can't take it
so i want to go to some classical
so you can go outta here
uh huh
so we go to the temple then right
yah yes
so without paying a cover charge
but if you are going to uh clarke quay and then uh on different pubs you have to pay cover charge
alright
so this is around about three pubs all together uh for the price of one
uh huh
yes
okay
this one is cool okay
and if you like you can probably uh try our singapore made zero degrees tiger beer
oh what do you call that
zero degree
we call it zero degrees tiger beer
oh is it because it's too cold that's why it's zero deg
yes it's very cold
oh okay
there is pudding also
are you a beer drinker that's why you're um suggesting that to me
in fact i'm a too ba actually i'm not a drinker but i have tried that particular uh beer the tiger beer a zero degree tiger beer
and i find it a little bit much more comfortable
uh huh
oh okay
yah
even i'm not a drinker but um it give me a good sense of you know uh taste
you get the buzz right
yah
you don't drink
come on
no drink
uh i am i uh in fact i'm allergic to alcohol
so
too bad
i'm so sorry to hear that
everybody must drink alcohol right
yah you can see from here on your screen right now um these are the few pubs which is uh there
and these are some of the events uh which is happening at the pub area
so if you wanna catch that um uh performance you probably come during that particular time to enjoy
yah
okay
yah
okay
um alright
got those noted
so um uh i guess i'm okay with the nightlife
now i don't know what to do in the morning and um i think i have already spent hundred and fifty let say two hundred fifty dollars on um entertainment and food for the evening at least right
uh what can i do in the morning
alright
in the morning i probably suggest to you to go to singapore botanical garden
oh which is one of the nice place that you should not miss
okay
beautiful flowers your ladies friends will love it
oh yah
oh but um uh you know when i went there the weather was really bad and very unpredictable like i need to get the umbrella up my head any time at any time because of the weather
how about first week of april
i need to plan my outfit right
yah
yah but uh you need not have to worry about the weather because at most of the time uh the weather for singapore is like there's usually the temperature is around about twenty six degrees to thirty five thirty six degrees
quite humid
the rains come and go within about an hour or two
okay
ah i don't wanna get wet
okay
okay
yah so you need even if you even if the rain start to fall it will only rain for that particular first or two hours
that's it
then it goes away
then you can go dance again
okay
so we chill somewhere and then we go out again right
yes correct
and right now the screen is up for the singapore botanical garden
okay
yes got it
right
you can see that um it's free admission so you need not have to pay
and to get there i'm trying to give you um to get there how to get there
alright
oh it's free admission
we then go to this place okay
oh this was free
good okay
yes alright
yah i guess you are happy with the free things right
yes of course
i'm gonna eat the flowers there before lunch time
botanical garden okay
right
if you were to see that uh there are some bus service uh which will takes you there uh via bukit timah you remember the hotel that you are staying at fragrance
and now i just pull back this a little bit
i just pull back to your hotel so that you can see where i'm talking about and
oh yes please
i easily get lost
yah
okay
and you can see from here right
this is your hotel isn't it
the fragrance hotel-selegie
now right in front of your hotel there is a bus stop
can you see my cursor
yes
right
this bus stop is heading towards bukit timah towards your the singapore botanical garden
so easily you can get a bus right from there
now the bus which is available to singapore botanical garden which i knew of uh is one seven zero
you can see bus one seven zero on the screen right now
uh there is the public buses sbs buses and that will takes you there
probably it will cost you at the most about a dollar for the bus ride
so the three of you would probably three dollars at the most yah
oh okay
oh yes
but uh the what you call uh the singapore botanical garden opens at five and it close in the middle midnight yah
opens at five
and of course morning
five a.m. in the morning
so you
oh my god
people go to the garden at five in the morning
they went for jogging they went for jogging they jog with their dogs and they jog with their loved ones in the early morning right
so the park is open in the early morning and of course uh if you go to botanical garden then i will say that you should not miss the national orchid garden
it's so beautiful inside there
we have lots of orchids there
and of course uh is there are lot of um celebrity orchids are also um placed inside the national orchid garden
and one of the uh orchids that you should not miss is also nelson mandela orchid
okay
uh huh
yes
alright
uh huh
oh okay
oh nelson mandela orchid
yah
his name are
nelson mandela
okay really
right
yes and we also have the um your president aquino
and that she also have a flower named after her
oh cool it's yellow i bet right
inside the sa yah
okay
yah you can go there also right
yes
okay
you can take some nice photograph of it yah
this is one good place to go to and then probably gonna go get brunch after
is there a restaurant somewhere near um the botanical garden
yah
yes there is
uh you can see f&b outlets and gift right
i'm gonna give you right now is the f&b outlets where you can have your meal yah
oh yah nice
yah
okay
so this is the f&b outlets
you can see there are so many restaurants located inside the uh botanical garden
how much is it gonna cost us for the lunch like uh one course
uh estimated price for one lunch will probably around about twenty to thirty dollars for uh
twenty to thirty dollars
okay wait
yah because you are going to a restaurant
you are not going to a food court
okay
you know i'm just kinda wondering because when i last went there every time i sit down with my brother and my sister-in-law we always spend like uh sixty uh what's that six singaporean dollars
that's quite that's expensive right
yah
uh that is because you are having three person right
oh yah that's for three persons
uh i see
so i said twenty dollars per person
oh my god
wait a minute
so this one um how much is it how much i'm gonna spend again for this place when i want to have a lunch in the what's this
uh as i said that uh the lunch wise you had to put something aside like twenty five dollars to thirty dollars per person because you are dining in a restaurant
you are not dining in a food court
uh oh my god
this is so expensive
okay fine
yah otherwise what you can do is you what you can do is you can walk across the other side of the street and have hawker food
or you can also a very cheap food there
now let me see i remember there is a food court available inside the botanical garden
oh yes
yah
there you go
food court i can understand
yah
yah
you can see uh there's a food court uh there
uh huh
just give me a minute huh the i give you the food court here
alright
yah we have a new food court uh inside the uh singapore botanical garden
uh there you are
that's the food for thought yah
located in
can you see
uh huh
oh okay
oh there is no picture it's because it's cheap huh
okay
fine
uh you know what uh huh
yah
yah correct
alright
so these are those are good uh there are good place there you can find cheap food as well but that also depends on you di
yes cause i only have a thousand um dollars right
i guess that's fine maybe at night we splurge but not in the morning right
maybe it's okay to be a little cheap right
okay
so i have one question for you
i need you to be totally honest with me um mathew
is my one thousand dollars enough for two days
am i gonna um survive or if i get lost will i still survive at one thousand um singaporean dollars
yah
uh yah
uh yes i would say yes
you should not be having any problem with that one thousand dollars unless you wanna give free drinks to everybody
okay
oh no way
see i'm gonna kick one of the friends right
all of it
uh you should give a free treat to me because
okay oh yah you know what you don't drink so you're really cheap date
i can just probably get you um what you call that coffee
kopi-o cof
okay
yah i will just get you one kopi-o for a cent or two right
no probably i should demand for ben and jerry
oh what's that again
ben and jerry's
oh yah what's that
ice cream
ice cream oh yes
lots of singaporeans love that
oh and um i'm probably gonna get two or three of snicker um ice cream bar cause there is none here in the philippines
yah
yah it's here
you can get it from here
right
right
yes okay
so i guess i'm cool with this
i've um one two three four places
and um since you already told me that one thousand singaporean dollars is gonna last me we'll just probably be spontaneous
i have a hotel i guess we're all good
do you have any more tips for me
yah
uh what do yo what else would you want
okay i was kinda think uh yes
i guess that one thousand dollar should be just nice for you yah
yes
as much as i wanna do more i only have a few
oh no i don't have enough money that's why
right
yah
uh yah because you are going to uh pubs uh to have drinks so you have to allocate that separately yah
right
exactly
yah
okay
that's it
i guess i have nothing else to ask you mathew
i have to say goodbye now
i need to thank you for your time
and uh try to get a drink come on
okay
okay
okay
yap
no proble uh okay i'll try
alright bye
so i wait for your time to come yah
okay
cause you actually have any uh more query you can feel free to call me again
okay
oh sure
alright
okay bye
